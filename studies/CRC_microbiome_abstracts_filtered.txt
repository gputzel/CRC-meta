In this study Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze and compare
human microbiota from three different compartments, i.e., saliva, feces, and
cancer tissue (CT), of a selected cohort of 10 Italian patients with colorectal
cancer (CRC) vs. 10 healthy controls (saliva and feces). Furthermore, the
Fusobacterium nucleatum abundance in the same body site was investigated through 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to assess the association
with CRC. Differences in bacterial composition, F. nucleatum abundance in healthy
controls vs. CRC patients, and the association of F. nucleatum with clinical
parameters were observed. Taxonomic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene, revealed the
presence of three main bacterial phyla, which includes about 80% of reads:
Firmicutes (39.18%), Bacteroidetes (30.36%), and Proteobacteria (10.65%). The
results highlighted the presence of different bacterial compositions; in
particular, the fecal samples of CRC patients seemed to be enriched with
Bacteroidetes, whereas in the fecal samples of healthy controls Firmicutes were
one of the major phyla detected though these differences were not statistically
significant. The CT samples showed the highest alpha diversity values. These
results emphasize a different taxonomic composition of feces from CRC compared to
healthy controls. Despite the low number of samples included in the study, these 
results suggest the importance of microbiota in the CRC progression and could
pave the way to the development of therapeutic interventions and novel
microbial-related diagnostic tools in CRC patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common cancer worldwide, with a
growing incidence among young adults. Multiple studies have presented
associations between the gut microbiome and CRC, suggesting a link with cancer
risk. Although CRC microbiome studies continue to profile larger patient cohorts 
with increasingly economical and rapid DNA sequencing platforms, few common
associations with CRC have been identified, in part due to limitations in
taxonomic resolution and differences in analysis methodologies. Complementing
these taxonomic studies is the newly recognized phenomenon that bacterial
organization into biofilm structures in the mucus layer of the gut is a
consistent feature of right-sided (proximal), but not left-sided (distal)
colorectal cancer. In the present study, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon
sequencing and biofilm quantification in a new cohort of patients from Malaysia, 
followed by a meta-analysis of eleven additional publicly available data sets on 
stool and tissue-based CRC microbiota using Resphera Insight, a high-resolution
analytical tool for species-level characterization. Results from the Malaysian
cohort and the expanded meta-analysis confirm that CRC tissues are enriched for
invasive biofilms (particularly on right-sided tumors), a symbiont with capacity 
for tumorigenesis (Bacteroides fragilis), and oral pathogens including
Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Peptostreptococcus stomatis.
Considered in aggregate, species from the Human Oral Microbiome Database are
highly enriched in CRC. Although no detected microbial feature was universally
present, their substantial overlap and combined prevalence supports a role for
the gut microbiota in a significant percentage (>80%) of CRC cases.

Colorectal cancers comprise a complex mixture of malignant cells, nontransformed 
cells, and microorganisms. Fusobacterium nucleatum is among the most prevalent
bacterial species in colorectal cancer tissues. Here we show that colonization of
human colorectal cancers with Fusobacterium and its associated
microbiome-including Bacteroides, Selenomonas, and Prevotella species-is
maintained in distal metastases, demonstrating microbiome stability between
paired primary and metastatic tumors. In situ hybridization analysis revealed
that Fusobacterium is predominantly associated with cancer cells in the
metastatic lesions. Mouse xenografts of human primary colorectal adenocarcinomas 
were found to retain viable Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome through
successive passages. Treatment of mice bearing a colon cancer xenograft with the 
antibiotic metronidazole reduced Fusobacterium load, cancer cell proliferation,
and overall tumor growth. These observations argue for further investigation of
antimicrobial interventions as a potential treatment for patients with
Fusobacterium-associated colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a worldwide health problem. Despite growing
evidence that members of the gut microbiota can drive tumorigenesis, little is
known about what happens to it after treatment for an adenoma or carcinoma. This 
study tested the hypothesis that treatment for adenoma or carcinoma alters the
abundance of bacterial populations associated with disease to those associated
with a normal colon. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes
in the feces of 67 individuals before and after treatment for adenoma (N = 22),
advanced adenoma (N = 19), and carcinoma (N = 26).
RESULTS: There were small changes to the bacterial community associated with
adenoma or advanced adenoma and large changes associated with carcinoma. The
communities from patients with carcinomas changed significantly more than those
with adenoma following treatment (P value < 0.001). Although treatment was
associated with intrapersonal changes, the change in the abundance of individual 
OTUs in response to treatment was not consistent within diagnosis groups (P value
> 0.05). Because the distribution of OTUs across patients and diagnosis groups
was irregular, we used the random forest machine learning algorithm to identify
groups of OTUs that could be used to classify pre and post-treatment samples for 
each of the diagnosis groups. Although the adenoma and carcinoma models could
reliably differentiate between the pre- and post-treatment samples (P value <
0.001), the advanced-adenoma model could not (P value = 0.61). Furthermore, there
was little overlap between the OTUs that were indicative of each treatment. To
determine whether individuals who underwent treatment were more likely to have
OTUs associated with normal colons we used a larger cohort that contained
individuals with normal colons and those with adenomas, advanced adenomas, and
carcinomas. We again built random forest models and measured the change in the
positive probability of having one of the three diagnoses to assess whether the
post-treatment samples received the same classification as the pre-treatment
samples. Samples from patients who had carcinomas changed toward a microbial
milieu that resembles the normal colon after treatment (P value < 0.001).
Finally, we were unable to detect any significant differences in the microbiota
of individuals treated with surgery alone and those treated with chemotherapy or 
chemotherapy and radiation (P value > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: By better understanding the response of the microbiota to treatment 
for adenomas and carcinomas, it is likely that biomarkers will eventually be
validated that can be used to quantify the risk of recurrence and the likelihood 
of survival. Although it was difficult to identify significant differences
between pre- and post-treatment samples from patients with adenoma and advanced
adenoma, this was not the case for carcinomas. Not only were there large changes 
in pre- versus post-treatment samples for those with carcinoma, but also these
changes were toward a more normal microbiota.

Increasing evidence suggests a role of the gut microbiota in colorectal
carcinogenesis (CRC). To detect bacterial markers of colorectal cancer in African
Americans a metabolomic analysis was performed on fecal water extracts. DNA from 
stool samples of adenoma and healthy subjects and from colon cancer and matched
normal tissues was analyzed to determine the microbiota composition (using 16S
rDNA) and genomic content (metagenomics). Metagenomic functions with
discriminative power between healthy and neoplastic specimens were established.
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (q-PCR) using primers and probes specific 
to Streptococcus sp. VT_162 were used to validate this bacterium association with
neoplastic transformation in stool samples from two independent cohorts of
African Americans and Chinese patients with colorectal lesions. The metabolomic
analysis of adenomas revealed low amino acids content. The microbiota in both
cancer vs. normal tissues and adenoma vs. normal stool samples were different at 
the 16S rRNA gene level. Cross-mapping of metagenomic data led to 9 markers with 
significant discriminative power between normal and diseased specimens. These
markers identified with Streptococcus sp. VT_162. Q-PCR data showed a
statistically significant presence of this bacterium in advanced adenoma and
cancer samples in an independent cohort of CRC patients. We defined metagenomic
functions from Streptococcus sp. VT_162 with discriminative power among cancers
vs. matched normal and adenomas vs. healthy subjects' stools. Streptococcus sp.
VT_162 specific 16S rDNA was validated in an independent cohort. These findings
might facilitate non-invasive screening for colorectal cancer.

It is well appreciated that microbial metabolism of drugs can influence treatment
efficacy. Microbial β-glucuronidases in the gut can reactivate the excreted,
inactive metabolite of irinotecan, a first-line chemotherapeutic for metastatic
colorectal cancer. Reactivation causes adverse drug responses, including severe
diarrhea. However, a direct connection between irinotecan metabolism and the
composition of an individual's gut microbiota has not previously been made. Here,
we report quantitative evidence of inter-individual variability in microbiome
metabolism of the inactive metabolite of irinotecan to its active form. We
identify a high turnover microbiota metabotype with potentially elevated risk for
irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses. We link the high turnover metabotype
to unreported microbial β-glucuronidases; inhibiting these enzymes may decrease
irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses in targeted subsets of patients. In
total, this study reveals metagenomic mining of the microbiome, combined with
metabolomics, as a non-invasive approach to develop biomarkers for colorectal
cancer treatment outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Microbiota alterations are linked with colorectal cancer
(CRC) and notably higher abundance of putative oral bacteria on colonic tumours. 
However, it is not known if colonic mucosa-associated taxa are indeed orally
derived, if such cases are a distinct subset of patients or if the oral
microbiome is generally suitable for screening for CRC.
METHODS: We profiled the microbiota in oral swabs, colonic mucosae and stool from
individuals with CRC (99 subjects), colorectal polyps (32) or controls (103).
RESULTS: Several oral taxa were differentially abundant in CRC compared with
controls, for example, Streptococcus and Prevotellas pp. A classification model
of oral swab microbiota distinguished individuals with CRC or polyps from
controls (sensitivity: 53% (CRC)/67% (polyps); specificity: 96%). Combining the
data from faecal microbiota and oral swab microbiota increased the sensitivity of
this model to 76% (CRC)/88% (polyps). We detected similar bacterial networks in
colonic microbiota and oral microbiota datasets comprising putative oral biofilm 
forming bacteria. While these taxa were more abundant in CRC, core networks
between pathogenic, CRC-associated oral bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus,
Parvimonas and Fusobacterium were also detected in healthy controls. High
abundance of Lachnospiraceae was negatively associated with the colonisation of
colonic tissue with oral-like bacterial networks suggesting a protective role for
certain microbiota types against CRC, possibly by conferring colonisation
resistance to CRC-associated oral taxa and possibly mediated through habitual
diet.
CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of CRC may relate to microbiota types that either
predispose or provide resistance to the disease, and profiling the oral
microbiome may offer an alternative screen for detecting CRC.

OBJECTIVE: The colonic microbiota is altered in patients with colorectal cancer
(CRC). We investigated the microbiota composition of patients with colon cancer
compared with controls devoid of neoplastic or inflammatory disease and the
potential to modify the colonic microbiota with probiotics.
DESIGN: Biopsy samples were obtained from the normal mucosa and tumour during
colonoscopy from 15 patients with colon cancer. Subsequent patient-matched
samples were taken at surgery from the tumour and nearby mucosa from the patients
with cancer, eight of whom had received two daily tablets totalling 1.4×1010 CFUs
Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 and 7×109 CFUs Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
Faecal samples were obtained after colonoscopy prior to starting the intervention
and at surgery. In addition, 21 mucosal biopsies from non-cancer controls were
obtained during colonoscopy followed by later faecal samples. The colonic and
faecal microbiota was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
RESULTS: The tumour microbiota was characterised by increased microbial diversity
and enrichment of several taxa including Fusobacterium, Selenomonas and
Peptostreptococcus compared with the control microbiota. Patients with colon
cancer that received probiotics had an increased abundance of butyrate-producing 
bacteria, especially Faecalibacterium and Clostridiales spp in the tumour,
non-tumour mucosa and faecal microbiota. CRC-associated genera such as
Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus tended to be reduced in the faecal
microbiota of patients that received probiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with colon cancer harbour a distinct microbiota signature
in the tumour tissue and nearby mucosa, which was altered with probiotic
intervention. Our results show promise for potential therapeutic benefits in CRC 
by manipulation of the microbiota.

Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD). In colorectal cancer, the gut microbiota has also been recognized as
potentially involved in aggravating or favoring the tumor development. However,
very little is known on the structure and role of the microbiota in colitis
associated cancer (CAC), an important complication of IBD in human. Here we
analyzed the bacterial and fungal composition of the mucosa associated microbiota
of patients suffering CAC, sporadic cancer (SC) and of healthy subjects (HS) by
barcode sequences analysis on the following cohort: 7 CAC patients, 10 SC
patients and 10 HS using 16S (MiSeq) and ITS2 (pyrosequencing) sequencing, for
bacteria and fungi respectively. Mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in CAC
was significantly different from the ones in SC or in HS, while the fungal showed
no differences. Comparison between mucosa-associated microbiota on the tumor site
or in normal mucosa near the tumor showed very similar patterns. The global
mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in cancer patients was characterized by a 
restriction in biodiversity but no change for the fungal community. Compared to
SC, CAC was characterized by an increase of Enterobacteriacae family and
Sphingomonas genus and a decrease of Fusobacterium and Ruminococcus genus. Our
study confirms the alteration of the mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in
IBD and SC. Although the cohort is limited in number, this is the first evidence 
of the existence of an altered bacterial microbiota in CAC clearly different from
the one in SC patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease and recent advances in subtype
classification have successfully stratified the disease using molecular
profiling. The contribution of bacterial species to CRC development is
increasingly acknowledged, and here, we sought to analyse CRC microbiomes and
relate them to tumour consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), in order to better
understand the relationship between bacterial species and the molecular
mechanisms associated with CRC subtypes. We classified 34 tumours into CRC
subtypes using RNA-sequencing derived gene expression and determined relative
abundances of bacterial taxonomic groups using 16S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding.
16S rRNA analysis showed enrichment of Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and
decreased levels of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in CMS1. A more detailed
analysis of bacterial taxa using non-human RNA-sequencing reads uncovered
distinct bacterial communities associated with each molecular subtype. The most
highly enriched species associated with CMS1 included Fusobacterium hwasookii and
Porphyromonas gingivalis. CMS2 was enriched for Selenomas and Prevotella species,
while CMS3 had few significant associations. Targeted quantitative PCR validated 
these findings and also showed an enrichment of Fusobacterium nucleatum,
Parvimonas micra and Peptostreptococcus stomatis in CMS1. In this study, we have 
successfully associated individual bacterial species to CRC subtypes for the
first time.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the microbiota community
structure, assess differences in intestinal bacterial types, and identify
metagenomic biomarkers for disparate stages of colorectal cancer formation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 160 individuals were recruited: 61 cases with
non-tumor colon were regarded as the normal group, 47 cases with
histology-substantiated colorectal adenomas were regarded as the adenoma group,
and 52 cases with invasive adenocarcinomas were regarded as the cancer group.
Biopsy on the mucosa was performed on each subject. USEARCH was used to process
the sequences data and generate OTUs. Gut mucosal microbiota from healthy
controls, adenoma patients, and carcinoma patients were analyzed. RESULTS
Principal coordinate analysis of unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance showed 
a separation in composition of microbiota in the 3 groups. Bacteria with
potential tumorigenesis, like Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium, were more
common in the carcinoma group, while some SCFA (short chain fatty
acids) - producing microbes were enriched in the normal group. The commensal
Escherichia were more abundant in adenoma patients. CONCLUSIONS Our study
provides insights into possible function of gut microbiota in diagnosis and
treatment of colorectal cancer. Some bacteria, such as Butyricicoccus, E. coli,
and Fusobacterium, can be used as potential biomarkers for normal, adenoma, and
cancer groups, respectively.

Colon cancer induces a state of mucosal dysbiosis with associated niche specific 
changes in the gut microbiota. However, the key metabolic functions of these
bacteria remain unclear. We performed a prospective observational study in
patients undergoing elective surgery for colon cancer without mechanical bowel
preparation (n = 18). Using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing we demonstrated that
microbiota ecology appears to be cancer stage-specific and strongly associated
with histological features of poor prognosis. Fusobacteria (p < 0.007) and ε-
Proteobacteria (p < 0.01) were enriched on tumour when compared to adjacent
normal mucosal tissue, and fusobacteria and β-Proteobacteria levels increased
with advancing cancer stage (p = 0.014 and 0.002 respecitvely). Metabonomic
analysis using 1H Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonsance  (MAS-NMR)
spectroscopy, demonstrated increased abundance of taurine, isoglutamine, choline,
lactate, phenylalanine and tyrosine and decreased levels of lipids and
triglycerides in tumour relative to adjacent healthy tissue. Network analysis
revealed that bacteria associated with poor prognostic features were not
responsible for the modification of the cancer mucosal metabonome. Thus the colon
cancer mucosal microbiome evolves with cancer stage to meet the demands of cancer
metabolism. Passenger microbiota may play a role in the maintenance of cancer
mucosal metabolic homeostasis but these metabolic functions may not be stage
specific.

Gut microbiota are linked to chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis.
Chemotherapy failure is the major cause of recurrence and poor prognosis in
colorectal cancer patients. Here, we investigated the contribution of gut
microbiota to chemoresistance in patients with colorectal cancer. We found that
Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum was abundant in colorectal cancer tissues in
patients with recurrence post chemotherapy, and was associated with patient
clinicopathological characterisitcs. Furthermore, our bioinformatic and
functional studies demonstrated that F. nucleatum promoted colorectal cancer
resistance to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum targeted TLR4 and MYD88
innate immune signaling and specific microRNAs to activate the autophagy pathway 
and alter colorectal cancer chemotherapeutic response. Thus, F. nucleatum
orchestrates a molecular network of the Toll-like receptor, microRNAs, and
autophagy to clinically, biologically, and mechanistically control colorectal
cancer chemoresistance. Measuring and targeting F. nucleatum and its associated
pathway will yield valuable insight into clinical management and may ameliorate
colorectal cancer patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Studies on gut microbiota regarding colorectal carcinogenesis,
including sessile serrated adenoma (SSA), have been scarce. The aim of this study
is to investigate the role of mucosa-associated gut microbiota in the colorectal 
carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We collected biopsy samples of normal rectal mucosa during colonoscopy
from healthy control and patients with conventional adenoma, SSA, and colorectal 
cancer (CRC), respectively (n = 6). Pyrosequencing for 16S rRNA gene of bacteria 
was performed to compare gut microbiota.
RESULTS: The most abundant phylum in total samples was Proteobacteria (55.6%),
followed by Firmicutes (27.4%) and Bacteroidetes (11.6%). There was no
significant difference in relative abundance of the phylum level among the four
groups. Fusobacterium nucleatum, known to be frequently detected during
colorectal carcinogenesis, was found in only one sample of patient with SSA. The 
rarefaction curves showed that the diversity of mucosal communities of patients
with CRC is the lowest among the four groups and the diversity of mucosal
communities of patients with SSA is higher than that of healthy control. Among
the four groups, Shannon's and Simpson's index for diversity was the lowest and
the highest in the patients with CRC, respectively; it did not reach statistical 
significance. The proportion of genus Pseudomonas was very high in the samples of
patients with stage II-IV CRC compared with those with stage I CRC (59.3% vs.
0.3%, P = 0.064).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests no significant role of mucosa-associated gut
microbiota in the colorectal carcinogenesis. Further study for many samples or
using fecal material could be helpful.

The aim of this study was to explore the gut microbiota profiles of colorectal
cancer (CRC) patients and to examine the relationship between gut microbiota and 
other key molecular factors involved in CRC tumorigenesis. In this study, a 16S
rDNA sequencing platform was used to identify possible differences in the
microbiota signature between CRC and adjacent normal mucosal tissue. Differences 
in the microbiota composition in different anatomical colorectal tumor sites and 
their potential association with KRAS mutation were also explored. In this study,
the number of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria decreased, while the number of
Fusobacteria increased in the gut of CRC patients. In addition, at the genus
level, Fusobacterium was identified as the key contributor to CRC tumorigenesis. 
In addition, a different distribution of gut microbiota in ascending and
descending colon cancer samples was observed. Lipopolysaccharide
biosynthesis-associated microbial genes were enriched in tumor tissues. Our study
suggests that specific mucosa-associated microbiota signature and function are
significantly changed in the gut of CRC patients, which may provide insight into 
the progression of CRC. These findings could also be of value in the creation of 
new prevention and treatment strategies for this type of cancer.

Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a specific species of gut microbiota, has been
suggested to be enriched in the microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) molecular
subtype of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). However, the clinicopathologic and
molecular factors that interact with Fn in MSI-H CRCs are poorly understood. In
this study, 16S ribosomal RNA gene DNA sequence of Fn was quantitatively measured
by real-time polymerase chain reaction in tumor DNA samples from a total of 160
surgically resected MSI-H CRC tissues. Each case was classified into one of the
three categories based on the Fn DNA amount: Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative.
The clinicopathologic and molecular associations of Fn in MSI-H CRCs were
statistically analyzed. Among the 160 MSI-H CRC samples, 15 (9%), 92 (58%), and
53 (33%) cases were Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative, respectively. Compared with
Fn-low/negative tumors, Fn-high MSI-H CRCs were significantly associated with a
high density of CD68+ tumor-infiltrating macrophages (P = 0.019) and promoter CpG
island hypermethylation of the CDKN2A (p16) gene (P = 0.008). There were also
tendencies toward associations of Fn-high with the BRAF V600E mutation
(P = 0.047) and active Crohn-like lymphoid reactions (P = 0.052) in MSI-H CRCs.
However, Fn-high was not significantly associated with CD3+ T cell density,
CD163+ M2 macrophage density or PD-L1 expression status. In conclusion, high
amounts of intratumoral Fn are correlated with increased macrophage infiltration 
and CDKN2A promoter methylation in MSI-H CRCs.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in both
men and women. The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as having an
important role in human health and disease. Fusobacterium has been identified in 
former studies as a leading gut bacterium associated with colorectal cancer, but 
it is still not clear if it plays an oncogenic role. In the current study, fecal 
samples were collected prior to bowel preparation from participants of screening 
colonoscopy in the German BliTz study. Using 16S rRNA gene analysis, we examined 
the presence and relative abundance of Fusobacterium in fecal samples from 500
participants, including 46, 113, 110 and 231 individuals with colorectal cancer, 
advanced adenomas, non-advanced adenomas and without any neoplasms, respectively.
We found that the abundance of Fusobacterium in feces was strongly associated
with the presence of colorectal cancer (P-value < 0.0001). This was confirmed by 
PCR at the species level for Fusobacterium nucleatum. However, no association was
seen with the presence of advanced adenomas (P-value = 0.80) or non-advanced
adenomas (P-value = 0.80), nor were there any associations observed with dietary 
or lifestyle habits. Although a causal role cannot be ruled out, our
observations, based on fecal microbiome, support the hypothesis that
Fusobacterium is a passenger that multiplies in the more favorable conditions
caused by the malignant tumor rather than a causal factor in colorectal cancer
development.

OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is higher in African Americans (AAs)
compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). A diet high in animal protein and fat
is an environmental risk factor for CRC development. The intestinal microbiota is
postulated to modulate the effects of diet in promoting or preventing CRC.
Hydrogen sulfide, produced by autochthonous sulfidogenic bacteria, triggers
proinflammatory pathways and hyperproliferation, and is genotoxic. We
hypothesised that sulfidogenic bacterial abundance in colonic mucosa may be an
environmental CRC risk factor that distinguishes AA and NHW.
DESIGN: Colonic biopsies from uninvolved or healthy mucosa from CRC cases and
tumour-free controls were collected prospectively from five medical centres in
Chicago for association studies. Sulfidogenic bacterial abundance in uninvolved
colonic mucosa of AA and NHW CRC cases was compared with normal mucosa of AA and 
NHW controls. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing was performed in AA cases and
controls. Correlations were examined among bacterial targets, race, disease
status and dietary intake.
RESULTS: AAs harboured a greater abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria compared with
NHWs regardless of disease status. Bilophila wadsworthia-specific dsrA was more
abundant in AA cases than controls. Linear discriminant analysis of 16S rRNA gene
sequences revealed five sulfidogenic genera that were more abundant in AA cases. 
Fat and protein intake and daily servings of meat were significantly higher in
AAs compared with NHWs, and multiple dietary components correlated with a higher 
abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria.
CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate sulfidogenic bacteria as a potential
environmental risk factor contributing to CRC development in AAs.

BACKGROUND: The equilibrium of oral microbiome may be altered by environmental
factors, including cigarette smoking. Several recent studies also suggest that
oral pathogens causing periodontal disease, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, are 
involved in pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.
METHODS: For this study oral rinse DNA samples from 190 participants in a
population-based case-control study for colorectal cancer were used to amplify a 
V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The amplicons were sequenced using
Illumina MiSeq paired end chemistry on two runs, yielding approximately 35
million filtered reads which were assigned to bacterial phyla.
RESULTS: No association was found between Fusobacterium abundance or presence and
colorectal cancer. However, adjusted for age and experimental batch, colorectal
cancer history was associated with increased presence of genus Lactobacillus and 
increased relative abundance of Rothia by 28% and current smoking was associated 
with a 33% decrease in relative counts of Betaproteobacteria (primarily
Neisseria) and 23% increase in relative abundance of Veillonellaceae family. We
also found that smoking had significant effects on the 2nd component scores and
2nd coordinate distances in principal component and coordinate analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: It remains to be elucidated whether the observed differences can be 
translated into biochemical changes in oral environment, thus potentially
affecting oral health.

Predicting colorectal cancer (CRC) based on fecal microbiota presents a promising
method for non-invasive screening of CRC, but the optimization of classification 
models remains an unaddressed question. The purpose of this study was to
systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different supervised
machine-learning models in predicting CRC in two independent eastern and western 
populations. The structures of intestinal microflora in feces in Chinese
population (N = 141) were determined by 454 FLX pyrosequencing, and different
supervised classifiers were employed to predict CRC based on fecal microbiota
operational taxonomic unit (OTUs). As a result, Bayes Net and Random Forest
displayed higher accuracies than other algorithms in both populations, although
Bayes Net was found with a lower false negative rate than that of Random Forest. 
Gut microbiota-based prediction was more accurate than the standard fecal occult 
blood test (FOBT), and the combination of both approaches further improved the
prediction accuracy. Moreover, when unclassified OTUs were used as input, the
BayesDMNB text algorithm achieved higher accuracy in the Chinese population
(AUC=0.994). Taken together, our results suggest that Bayes Net classification
model combined with unclassified OTUs may present an accurate method for
predicting CRC based on the compositions of gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease arising from at least
two precursors-the conventional adenoma (CA) and the serrated polyp. We and
others have previously shown a relationship between the human gut microbiota and 
colorectal cancer; however, its relationship to the different early precursors of
colorectal cancer is understudied. We tested, for the first time, the
relationship of the gut microbiota to specific colorectal polyp types.
RESULTS: Gut microbiota were assessed in 540 colonoscopy-screened adults by 16S
rRNA gene sequencing of stool samples. Participants were categorized as CA cases 
(n = 144), serrated polyp cases (n = 73), or polyp-free controls (n = 323). CA
cases were further classified as proximal (n = 87) or distal (n = 55) and as
non-advanced (n = 121) or advanced (n = 22). Serrated polyp cases were further
classified as hyperplastic polyp (HP; n = 40) or sessile serrated adenoma (SSA;
n = 33). We compared gut microbiota diversity, overall composition, and
normalized taxon abundance among these groups. CA cases had lower species
richness in stool than controls (p = 0.03); in particular, this association was
strongest for advanced CA cases (p = 0.004). In relation to overall microbiota
composition, only distal or advanced CA cases differed significantly from
controls (p = 0.02 and p = 0.002). In taxon-based analysis, stool of CA cases was
depleted in a network of Clostridia operational taxonomic units from families
Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, and enriched in the classes
Bacilli and Gammaproteobacteria, order Enterobacteriales, and genera Actinomyces 
and Streptococcus (all q < 0.10). SSA and HP cases did not differ in diversity or
composition from controls, though sample size for these groups was small. Few
taxa were differentially abundant between HP cases or SSA cases and controls;
among them, class Erysipelotrichi was depleted in SSA cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that gut microbes may play a role in the early 
stages of colorectal carcinogenesis through the development of CAs. Findings may 
have implications for developing colorectal cancer prevention therapies targeting
early microbial drivers of colorectal carcinogenesis.

Sporadic and inflammatory forms of colorectal cancer (CRC) account for more than 
80% of cases. Recent publications have shown mechanistic evidence for the
involvement of gut bacteria in the development of both CRC-forms. Whereas, colon 
and rectal cancer have been routinely studied together as CRC, increasing
evidence show these to be distinct diseases. Also, the common use of fecal
samples to study microbial communities may reflect disease state but possibly not
the tumor microenvironment. We performed this study to evaluate differences in
bacterial communities found in tissue samples of 18 rectal-cancer subjects when
compared to 18 non-cancer controls. Samples were collected during exploratory
colonoscopy (non-cancer group) or during surgery for tumor excision
(rectal-cancer group). High throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4-V5 
region was conducted on the Ion PGM platform, reads were filtered using Qiime and
clustered using UPARSE. We observed significant increases in species richness and
diversity in rectal cancer samples, evidenced by the total number of OTUs and the
Shannon and Simpson indexes. Enterotyping analysis divided our cohort into two
groups, with the majority of rectal cancer samples clustering into one
enterotype, characterized by a greater abundance of Bacteroides and Dorea. At the
phylum level, rectal-cancer samples had increased abundance of candidate phylum
OD1 (also known as Parcubacteria) whilst non-cancer samples had increased
abundance of Planctomycetes. At the genera level, rectal-cancer samples had
higher abundances of Bacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Parabacteroides,
Desulfovibrio, and Odoribacter whereas non-cancer samples had higher abundances
of Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Acinetobacter, Lactobacillus, and Bacillus. Two
Bacteroides fragilis OTUs were more abundant among rectal-cancer patients seen
through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, whose presence was confirmed by
immunohistochemistry and enrichment verified by digital droplet PCR. Our findings
point to increased bacterial richness and diversity in rectal cancer, along with 
several differences in microbial community composition. Our work is the first to 
present evidence for a possible role of bacteria such as B. fragilis and the
phylum Parcubacteria in rectal cancer, emphasizing the need to study
tissue-associated bacteria and specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract in 
order to better understand the possible links between the microbiota and rectal
cancer.

BACKGROUND: There is a significant demand for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
methods that are noninvasive, inexpensive, and capable of accurately detecting
early stage tumors. It has been shown that models based on the gut microbiota can
complement the fecal occult blood test and fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
However, a barrier to microbiota-based screening is the need to collect and store
a patient's stool sample.
RESULTS: Using stool samples collected from 404 patients, we tested whether the
residual buffer containing resuspended feces in FIT cartridges could be used in
place of intact stool samples. We found that the bacterial DNA isolated from FIT 
cartridges largely recapitulated the community structure and membership of
patients' stool microbiota and that the abundance of bacteria associated with CRC
were conserved. We also found that models for detecting CRC that were generated
using bacterial abundances from FIT cartridges were equally predictive as models 
generated using bacterial abundances from stool.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential for using residual buffer
from FIT cartridges in place of stool for microbiota-based screening for CRC.
This may reduce the need to collect and process separate stool samples and may
facilitate combining FIT and microbiota-based biomarkers into a single test.
Additionally, FIT cartridges could constitute a novel data source for studying
the role of the microbiome in cancer and other diseases.

BACKGROUND: Despite many potential effects of the oral microbiome on oral and
systemic health, scant information is available regarding the associations
between diet and the oral microbiome.
METHODS: Oral rinse DNA samples from 182 participants in a population-based
case-control study for colorectal cancer were used to amplify a V3-V4 region of
bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The amplicons were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq paired
end chemistry on 2 runs, yielding approximately 33 million filtered reads that
were assigned to bacterial classes. Relative abundances of each class and family 
as well microbial diversity/richness indices were correlated with selected
dietary intakes from a food frequency questionnaire.
RESULTS: Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and vitamin C intakes were consistently
correlated with alpha (within-subjects) diversity indexes in both richness and
diversity. SFA intake was positively correlated with relative abundance of
betaproteobacteria and fusobacteria. Vitamin C and other vitamins with correlated
intakes-for example, the B vitamins and vitamin E-exhibited positive correlations
with fusobacteria class, its family Leptotrichiaceae and a clostridia family
Lachnospiraceae. In addition, glycemic load was positively correlated with
Lactobacillaceae abundance.
CONCLUSION: The observed associations in this study were modest. However, the
results suggest that the effects of diets are likely to be habitat specific, and 
observations from the gut microbiome are not transferrable to the oral
microbiome. Further studies are warranted, incorporating a range of host
biomarkers, such as cytohistological, molecular, or biochemical measurements, in 
order to address biological consequences of these dietary intakes in human oral
health.

BACKGROUND: Adenomatous polyps are the most common precursor to colorectal
cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. We
sought to learn more about early events of carcinogenesis by investigating shifts
in the gut microbiota of patients with adenomas.
METHODS: We analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequences from the fecal microbiota of
patients with adenomas (n = 233) and without (n = 547).
RESULTS: Multiple taxa were significantly more abundant in patients with
adenomas, including Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, proinflammatory bacteria in the
genus Mogibacterium, and multiple Bacteroidetes species. Patients without
adenomas had greater abundances of Veillonella, Firmicutes (Order Clostridia),
and Actinobacteria (family Bifidobacteriales). Our findings were consistent with 
previously reported shifts in the gut microbiota of colorectal cancer patients.
Importantly, the altered adenoma profile is predicted to increase primary and
secondary bile acid production, as well as starch, sucrose, lipid, and
phenylpropanoid metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: These data hint that increased sugar, protein, and lipid metabolism 
along with increased bile acid production could promote a colonic environment
that supports the growth of bile-tolerant microbes such as Bilophilia and
Desulfovibrio In turn, these microbes may produce genotoxic or inflammatory
metabolites such as H2S and secondary bile acids, which could play a role in
catalyzing adenoma development and eventually colorectal cancer.
IMPACT: This study suggests a plausible biological mechanism to explain the links
between shifts in the microbiota and colorectal cancer. This represents a first
step toward resolving the complex interactions that shape the adenoma-carcinoma
sequence of colorectal cancer and may facilitate personalized therapeutics
focused on the microbiota. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(1); 85-94. ©2016

Recent reports have suggested that the gut microbiota is involved in the
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The composition of gut microbiota in CRC 
precursors has not been adequately described. To characterize the structure of
adherent microbiota in this disease, we conducted pyrosequencing-based analysis
of 16S rRNA genes to determine the bacterial profile of normal colons (healthy
controls) and colorectal adenomas (CRC precursors). Adenoma mucosal biopsy
samples and adjacent normal colonic mucosa from 31 patients with adenomas and 20 
healthy volunteers were profiled using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Principal
coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed structural segregation between colorectal
adenomatous tissue and control tissue. Alpha diversity estimations revealed
higher microbiota diversity in samples from patients with adenomas. Taxonomic
analysis illustrated that abundance of eight phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria,
Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Candidate-division
TM7, and Tenericutes) was significantly different. In addition, Lactococcus and
Pseudomonas were enriched in preneoplastic tissue, whereas Enterococcus,
Bacillus, and Solibacillus were reduced. However, both PCoA and cluster tree
analyses showed similar microbiota structure between adenomatous and adjacent
non-adenoma tissues. These present findings provide preliminary experimental
evidence supporting that colorectal preneoplastic lesion may be the most
important factor leading to alterations in bacterial community composition.

Fusobacteria are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and are amplified during
colorectal carcinogenesis. Compared to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence of
carcinogenesis, serrated neoplasm has distinct clinical features and a different 
molecular background. We aimed to compare the gut microbiome between tubular
adenoma (TA) and sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P). Patients with TA, SSA/P,
or CRC were recruited. Three pieces of colorectal mucosal tissue were obtained
from each patient by endoscopic biopsy. 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and
phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states 
(PICRUSt) were performed. Among 26 enrolled patients, 8, 10, and 8 had TA, SSA/P,
and CRC, respectively. The relative abundance of Fusobacteria did not differ
significantly between the TA and SSA/P groups (4.3% and 1.9%, P = 0.739) but was 
higher in the CRC group (33.8%) than in the TA or SSA/P group, respectively (TA
vs. CRC, P = 0.002, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.023; SSA/P vs. CRC, P < 0.001,
FDR = 0.001). PICRUSt revealed that most functions in the TA metagenome were
similar to those in the SSA/P metagenome. The gut microbiome, including relative 
abundance of Fusobacteria, did not differ between TA and SSA/P, suggesting that
Fusobacteria may contribute to both the serrated pathway and the
adenoma-carcinoma sequence.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death among
cancers in the United States. Although individuals diagnosed early have a greater
than 90% chance of survival, more than one-third of individuals do not adhere to 
screening recommendations partly because the standard diagnostics, colonoscopy
and sigmoidoscopy, are expensive and invasive. Thus, there is a great need to
improve the sensitivity of non-invasive tests to detect early stage cancers and
adenomas. Numerous studies have identified shifts in the composition of the gut
microbiota associated with the progression of CRC, suggesting that the gut
microbiota may represent a reservoir of biomarkers that would complement existing
non-invasive methods such as the widely used fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
METHODS: We sequenced the 16S rRNA genes from the stool samples of 490 patients. 
We used the relative abundances of the bacterial populations within each sample
to develop a random forest classification model that detects colonic lesions
using the relative abundance of gut microbiota and the concentration of
hemoglobin in stool.
RESULTS: The microbiota-based random forest model detected 91.7% of cancers and
45.5% of adenomas while FIT alone detected 75.0% and 15.7%, respectively. Of the 
colonic lesions missed by FIT, the model detected 70.0% of cancers and 37.7% of
adenomas. We confirmed known associations of Porphyromonas assaccharolytica,
Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Parvimonas micra, and Fusobacterium nucleatum with
CRC. Yet, we found that the loss of potentially beneficial organisms, such as
members of the Lachnospiraceae, was more predictive for identifying patients with
adenomas when used in combination with FIT.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential for microbiota analysis to 
complement existing screening methods to improve detection of colonic lesions.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Investigation of microbe-metabolite relationships in the gut
is needed to understand and potentially reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) risk.
METHODS: Microbiota and metabolomics profiling were performed on lyophilized
feces from 42 CRC cases and 89 matched controls. Multivariable logistic
regression was used to identify statistically independent associations with CRC. 
First principal coordinate-component pair (PCo1-PC1) and false discovery rate
(0.05)-corrected P-values were calculated for 116,000 Pearson correlations
between 530 metabolites and 220 microbes in a sex*case/control meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Overall microbe-metabolite PCo1-PC1 was more strongly correlated in
cases than in controls (Rho 0.606 vs 0.201, P = 0.01). CRC was independently
associated with lower levels of Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, p-aminobenzoate and 
conjugated linoleate, and with higher levels of Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas,
p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, and palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Through postulated effects
on cell shedding (palmitoyl-sphingomyelin), inflammation (conjugated linoleate), 
and innate immunity (p-aminobenzoate), metabolites mediated the CRC association
with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas by 29% and 34%, respectively. Overall,
palmitoyl-sphingomyelin correlated directly with abundances of Enterobacteriaceae
(Gammaproteobacteria), three Actinobacteria and five Firmicutes. Only
Parabacteroides correlated inversely with palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Other lipids
correlated inversely with Alcaligenaceae (Betaproteobacteria). Six
Bonferroni-significant correlations were found, including low indolepropionate
and threnoylvaline with Actinobacteria and high erythronate and an
uncharacterized metabolite with Enterobacteriaceae.
CONCLUSIONS: Feces from CRC cases had very strong microbe-metabolite correlations
that were predominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Actinobacteria. Metabolites
mediated a direct CRC association with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas, but not
an inverse association with Clostridia and Lachnospiraceae. This study identifies
complex microbe-metabolite networks that may provide insights on neoplasia and
targets for intervention.

OBJECTIVE: A signature that unifies the colorectal cancer (CRC) microbiota across
multiple studies has not been identified. In addition to methodological variance,
heterogeneity may be caused by both microbial and host response differences,
which was addressed in this study.
DESIGN: We prospectively studied the colonic microbiota and the expression of
specific host response genes using faecal and mucosal samples ('ON' and 'OFF' the
tumour, proximal and distal) from 59 patients undergoing surgery for CRC, 21
individuals with polyps and 56 healthy controls. Microbiota composition was
determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing; expression of host genes involved in 
CRC progression and immune response was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: The microbiota of patients with CRC differed from that of controls, but 
alterations were not restricted to the cancerous tissue. Differences between
distal and proximal cancers were detected and faecal microbiota only partially
reflected mucosal microbiota in CRC. Patients with CRC can be stratified based on
higher level structures of mucosal-associated bacterial co-abundance groups
(CAGs) that resemble the previously formulated concept of enterotypes. Of these, 
Bacteroidetes Cluster 1 and Firmicutes Cluster 1 were in decreased abundance in
CRC mucosa, whereas Bacteroidetes Cluster 2, Firmicutes Cluster 2, Pathogen
Cluster and Prevotella Cluster showed increased abundance in CRC mucosa.
CRC-associated CAGs were differentially correlated with the expression of host
immunoinflammatory response genes.
CONCLUSIONS: CRC-associated microbiota profiles differ from those in healthy
subjects and are linked with distinct mucosal gene-expression profiles.
Compositional alterations in the microbiota are not restricted to cancerous
tissue and differ between distal and proximal cancers.

OBJECTIVE: To compare fecal microbiota and metabolites between colorectal cancer 
(CRC) patients and healthy population.
METHODS: Feces from fifteen CRC patients and twelve normal people were analyzed
by using pyrosequencing and gas chromatography mass spectrometry(GC/MS).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the overall microbial community
structure associated with the disease state, but 18 bacterial genera were
underrepresented or overrepresented in the CRC samples. GC-MS profiling revealed 
higher concentrations for 9 kinds of amino acids and metabolites of short-chain
fatty acids, lower concentrations for 3 kinds of unsaturated fatty acids and 2
kinds of glycerin and ursodeoxycholic acid in stool samples from CRC patients.
Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential
relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species.
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in fecal metabolites and the
relative abundance of certain types of bacteria between CRC patients and healthy 
people, which can provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer 
environment and will help direct future mechanism studies.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
Japan. The etiology of CRC has been linked to numerous factors including genetic 
mutation, diet, life style, inflammation, and recently, the gut microbiota.
However, CRC-associated gut microbiota is still largely unexamined. This study
used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and
next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze and compare gut microbiota of
Japanese control subjects and Japanese patients with carcinoma in adenoma. Stool 
samples were collected from 49 control subjects, 50 patients with colon adenoma, 
and 9 patients with colorectal cancer (3/9 with invasive cancer and 6/9 with
carcinoma in adenoma) immediately before colonoscopy; DNA was extracted from each
stool sample. Based on T-RFLP analysis, 12 subjects (six control and six
carcinoma in adenoma subjects) were selected; their samples were used for NGS and
species-level analysis. T-RFLP analysis showed no significant differences in
bacterial population between control, adenoma and cancer groups. However, NGS
revealed that i), control and carcinoma in adenoma subjects had different gut
microbiota compositions, ii), one bacterial genus (Slackia) was significantly
associated with the control group and four bacterial genera (Actinomyces,
Atopobium, Fusobacterium, and Haemophilus) were significantly associated with the
carcinoma-in-adenoma group, and iii), several bacterial species were
significantly associated with each type (control: Eubacterium coprostanoligens;
carcinoma in adenoma: Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides fragiles,
Clostridium nexile, Fusobacterium varium, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Prevotella 
stercorea, Streptococcus gordonii, and Veillonella dispar). Gut microbial
properties differ between control subjects and carcinoma-in-adenoma patients in
this Japanese population, suggesting that gut microbiota is related to CRC
prevention and development.

Gut microbial dysbiosis contributes to the development of colorectal cancer
(CRC). Here we catalogue the microbial communities in human gut mucosae at
different stages of colorectal tumorigenesis. We analyse the gut mucosal
microbiome of 47 paired samples of adenoma and adenoma-adjacent mucosae, 52
paired samples of carcinoma and carcinoma-adjacent mucosae and 61 healthy
controls. Probabilistic partitioning of relative abundance profiles reveals that 
a metacommunity predominated by members of the oral microbiome is primarily
associated with CRC. Analysis of paired samples shows differences in community
configurations between lesions and the adjacent mucosae. Correlations of
bacterial taxa indicate early signs of dysbiosis in adenoma, and co-exclusive
relationships are subsequently more common in cancer. We validate these
alterations in CRC-associated microbiome by comparison with two previously
published data sets. Our results suggest that a taxonomically defined microbial
consortium is implicated in the development of CRC.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) from 
faecal metagenomes.
DESIGN: We performed metagenome-wide association studies on faecal samples from
74 patients with CRC and 54 controls from China, and validated the results in 16 
patients and 24 controls from Denmark. We further validated the biomarkers in two
published cohorts from France and Austria. Finally, we employed targeted
quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to evaluate diagnostic potential of selected
biomarkers in an independent Chinese cohort of 47 patients and 109 controls.
RESULTS: Besides confirming known associations of Fusobacterium nucleatum and
Peptostreptococcus stomatis with CRC, we found significant associations with
several species, including Parvimonas micra and Solobacterium moorei. We
identified 20 microbial gene markers that differentiated CRC and control
microbiomes, and validated 4 markers in the Danish cohort. In the French and
Austrian cohorts, these four genes distinguished CRC metagenomes from controls
with areas under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.77,
respectively. qPCR measurements of two of these genes accurately classified
patients with CRC in the independent Chinese cohort with AUC=0.84 and OR of 23.
These genes were enriched in early-stage (I-II) patient microbiomes, highlighting
the potential for using faecal metagenomic biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first metagenomic profiling study of CRC faecal
microbiomes to discover and validate microbial biomarkers in ethnically different
cohorts, and to independently validate selected biomarkers using an affordable
clinically relevant technology. Our study thus takes a step further towards
affordable non-invasive early diagnostic biomarkers for CRC from faecal samples.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence links colorectal cancer (CRC) with the
intestinal microbiota. However, the disturbance of intestinal microbiota and the 
role of Fusobacterium nucleatum during the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence 
have not yet been evaluated.
METHODS: 454 FLX pyrosequencing was used to evaluate the disturbance of
intestinal microbiota during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence pathway of CRC.
Intestinal microbiota and mucosa tumor-immune cytokines were detected in mice
after introducing 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), F. nucleatum or Berberine (BBR),
using pyrosequencing and Bio-Plex Pro™ cytokine assays, respectively. Protein
expressions were detected by western blotting.
RESULTS: The levels of opportunistic pathogens, such as Fusobacterium,
Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. gradually increased during the colorectal
adenoma-carcinoma sequence in human fecal and mucosal samples. F. nucleatum
treatment significantly altered lumen microbial structures, with increased
Tenericutes and Verrucomicrobia (opportunistic pathogens) (P < 0.05 = in
wild-type C57BL/6 and mice with DMH treatment). BBR intervention reversed the F. 
nucleatum-mediated increase in opportunistic pathogens, and the secretion of
IL-21/22/31, CD40L and the expression of p-STAT3, p-STAT5 and p-ERK1/2 in mice,
compared with mice fed with F. nucleatum alone.
CONCLUSIONS: F. nucleatum colonization in the intestine may prompt colorectal
tumorigenesis. BBR could rescue F. nucleatum-induced colorectal tumorigenesis by 
modulating the tumor microenvironment and blocking the activation of
tumorigenesis-related pathways.

BACKGROUND: Microbiotical dysbiosis induced by a Western diet seems to be
associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Few
other factors with an effect on the colonic microbiota and their association with
CRC have been evaluated.
AIM: We investigated whether the use of antibiotics is associated with CRC risk.
METHODS: Data on the use of antibiotics and comedication were extracted from a
health insurance database for subjects with a diagnostic-related group for CRC
between 2006 and 2011 and four age- and sex-matched controls. Antibiotic use was 
categorized according to the number of prescriptions during a 5-year follow-up
period (1-6 years prior to CRC). Multivariable conditional binary logistic
regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence
intervals (95 % CIs) for different levels of use.
RESULTS: A total of 4029 cases (47 % male, mean age at diagnosis 71 ± 11 years)
and 15,988 controls were included. Antibiotics had been prescribed to 2630 (65.3 
%) cases and 10,234 (64.0 %) controls (p = 0.13). An increasing use of
antibiotics was associated with an increasing risk of CRC [multivariable OR for
high (≥8 prescriptions) vs. no prescriptions: 1.26, 95 % CI 1.11-1.44, p-trend
<0.01]. For each increase of 5 prescriptions, the OR for CRC was 1.05 (95 % CI
1.01-1.09).
CONCLUSION: We found an association between the use of antibiotics, especially
when used frequently, and the risk of developing CRC. Further studies are needed 
to establish under which conditions the use of antibiotics increases the risk of 
developing CRC.

BACKGROUND: Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous colorectal
adenoma (CRA) can detect curable disease. However, participation in colonoscopy
and sensitivity of fecal heme for CRA are low.
METHODS: Microbiota metrics were determined by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA
genes amplified from DNA extracted from feces self-collected in RNAlater. Among
fecal immunochemical test-positive (FIT +) participants, colonoscopically-defined
normal versus CRA patients were compared by regression, permutation, and random
forest plus leave-one-out methods.
FINDINGS: Of 95 FIT + participants, 61 had successful fecal microbiota profiling 
and colonoscopy, identifying 24 completely normal patients, 20 CRA patients, 2
CRC patients, and 15 with other conditions. Phylum-level fecal community
composition differed significantly between CRA and normal patients (permutation
P = 0.02). Rank phylum-level abundance distinguished CRA from normal patients
(area under the curve = 0.767, permutation P = 0.006). CRA prevalence was 59% in 
phylum-level cluster B versus 20% in cluster A (exact P = 0.01). Most of the
difference reflected 3-fold higher median relative abundance of Proteobacteria
taxa (Wilcoxon signed-rank P = 0.03, positive predictive value = 67%). Antibiotic
exposure and other potential confounders did not affect the associations.
INTERPRETATION: If confirmed in larger, more diverse populations, fecal
microbiota analysis might be employed to improve screening for CRA and ultimately
to reduce mortality from CRC.

Obesity is a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), and alterations in the
colonic microbiome and metabolome may be mechanistically involved in this
relationship. The relative contribution of diet and obesity per se are unclear.
We compared the effect of diet- and genetically-induced obesity on the intestinal
microbiome and metabolome in a mouse model of CRC. Apc1638N mice were made obese 
by either high fat (HF) feeding or the presence of the Leprdb/db (DbDb) mutation.
Intestinal tumors were quantified and stool microbiome and metabolome were
profiled. Genetic obesity, and to a lesser extent HF feeding, promoted intestinal
tumorigenesis. Each induced distinct microbial patterns: taxa enriched in HF were
mostly Firmicutes (6 of 8) while those enriched in DbDb were split between
Firmicutes (7 of 12) and Proteobacteria (5 of 12). Parabecteroides distasonis was
lower in tumor-bearing mice and its abundance was inversely associated with
colonic Il1b production (p<0.05). HF and genetic obesity altered the abundance of
49 and 40 fecal metabolites respectively, with 5 in common. Of these 5, adenosine
was also lower in obese and in tumor-bearing mice (p<0.05) and its concentration 
was inversely associated with colonic Il1b and Tnf production (p<0.05). HF and
genetic obesity differentially alter the intestinal microbiome and metabolome. A 
depletion of adenosine and P.distasonis in tumor-bearing mice could play a
mechanistic role in tumor formation. Adenosine and P. distasonis have previously 
been shown to be anti-inflammatory in the colon and we postulate their reduction 
could promote tumorigenesis by de-repressing inflammation.

Studies using animal models have demonstrated that probiotics may have a
beneficial role in the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the
underlying mechanism of the beneficial effects of interventional probiotic
treatment on gut microbiota has remained elusive. In the present study,
pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes was conducted in order to
determine the extent to which probiotics alter the microbiota. The observations
of the present study indicated that the microbial structure of cancerous tissue
differed significantly from that of healthy individuals and that the CRC
microbiota exhibited lower diversity. It was indicated that interventional
treatment with probiotics increased the density and diversity of mucosal
microbes, and altered the mucosa‑associated microbiota. Pyrosequencing
demonstrated that probiotics significantly reduced (5‑fold) the abundance of a
bacterial taxon assigned to the genus Fusobacterium, which had been previously
suggested to be a contributing factor to increase tumorigenesis. Accordingly,
interventional probiotic therapy is suggested to be able to improve the
composition of the mucosal microbial flora and significantly reduce the abundance
of mucosa-associated pathogens in patients with CRC.

Introduction: Metabolomics is a valuable tool for biomarker screening of
colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we profiled the urinary metabolomes of
patients enrolled in a prospective patient cohort (ColoCare). We aimed to
describe changes in the metabolome in the longer clinical follow-up and describe 
initial predictors as candidate markers with possibly prognostic significance.
Methods: In total, 199 urine samples from CRC patients pre-surgery (n=97), 1-8
days post-surgery (n=12) and then after 6 and 12 months (n=52 and 38,
respectively) were analyzed using both GC-MS and 1H-NMR. Both datasets were
analyzed separately with built in uni- and multivariate analyses of Metaboanalyst
2.0. Furthermore, adjusted linear mixed effects regression models were
constructed.
Results: Many concentrations of the metabolites derived from the gut microbiome
were affected by CRC surgery, presumably indicating a tumor-induced shift in
bacterial species. Associations of the microbial metabolites with disease stage
indicate an important role of the gut microbiome in CRC.We were able to
differentiate the metabolite profiles of CRC patients prior to surgery from those
at any post-surgery timepoint using a multivariate model containing 20 marker
metabolites (AUCROC=0.89; 95% CI:0.84-0.95).
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first metabolomic
studies to follow CRC patients in a prospective setting with repeated urine
sampling over time. We were able to confirm markers initially identified in
case-control studies and pin point metabolites which may serve as candidates for 
prognostic biomarkers of CRC.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota influences the progression of
colitis-associated colorectal cancer. With diet being a key determinant of the
gut microbial ecology, dietary interventions are an attractive avenue for the
prevention of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Curcumin is the most active
constituent of the ground rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant, which has been
demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiproliferative
properties.
METHODS: Il10 mice on 129/SvEv background were used as a model of
colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Starting at 10 weeks of age, wild-type or
Il10 mice received 6 weekly intraperitoneal injections of azoxymethane (AOM) or
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were started on either a control or a
curcumin-supplemented diet. Stools were collected every 4 weeks for microbial
community analysis. Mice were killed at 30 weeks of age.
RESULTS: Curcumin-supplemented diet increased survival, decreased colon
weight/length ratio, and, at 0.5%, entirely eliminated tumor burden. Although
colonic histology indicated improvement with curcumin, no effects of mucosal
immune responses have been observed in PBS/Il10 mice and limited effects were
seen in AOM/Il10 mice. In wild-type and in Il10 mice, curcumin increased
bacterial richness, prevented age-related decrease in alpha diversity, increased 
the relative abundance of Lactobacillales, and decreased Coriobacterales order.
Taxonomic profile of AOM/Il10 mice receiving curcumin was more similar to those
of wild-type mice than those fed control diet.
CONCLUSIONS: In AOM/Il10 model, curcumin reduced or eliminated colonic tumor
burden with limited effects on mucosal immune responses. The beneficial effect of
curcumin on tumorigenesis was associated with the maintenance of a more diverse
colonic microbial ecology.

Colorectal cancer risk is associated with diets high in red meat. Heme, the
pigment of red meat, induces cytotoxicity of colonic contents and elicits
epithelial damage and compensatory hyperproliferation, leading to hyperplasia.
Here we explore the possible causal role of the gut microbiota in heme-induced
hyperproliferation. To this end, mice were fed a purified control or heme diet
(0.5 μmol/g heme) with or without broad-spectrum antibiotics for 14 d.
Heme-induced hyperproliferation was shown to depend on the presence of the gut
microbiota, because hyperproliferation was completely eliminated by antibiotics, 
although heme-induced luminal cytotoxicity was sustained in these mice. Colon
mucosa transcriptomics revealed that antibiotics block heme-induced differential 
expression of oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and cell turnover genes, implying
that antibiotic treatment prevented the heme-dependent cytotoxic micelles to
reach the epithelium. Our results indicate that this occurs because antibiotics
reinforce the mucus barrier by eliminating sulfide-producing bacteria and
mucin-degrading bacteria (e.g., Akkermansia). Sulfide potently reduces disulfide 
bonds and can drive mucin denaturation and microbial access to the mucus layer.
This reduction results in formation of trisulfides that can be detected in vitro 
and in vivo. Therefore, trisulfides can serve as a novel marker of colonic
mucolysis and thus as a proxy for mucus barrier reduction. In feces, antibiotics 
drastically decreased trisulfides but increased mucin polymers that can be lysed 
by sulfide. We conclude that the gut microbiota is required for heme-induced
epithelial hyperproliferation and hyperplasia because of the capacity to reduce
mucus barrier function.

Here, we show that autophagy is activated in the intestinal epithelium in murine 
and human colorectal cancer and that the conditional inactivation of Atg7 in
intestinal epithelial cells inhibits the formation of pre-cancerous lesions in
Apc(+/-) mice by enhancing anti-tumour responses. The antibody-mediated depletion
of CD8(+) T cells showed that these cells are essential for the anti-tumoral
responses mediated by the inhibition of autophagy. We show that Atg7 deficiency
leads to intestinal dysbiosis and that the microbiota is required for anticancer 
responses. In addition, Atg7 deficiency resulted in a stress response accompanied
by metabolic defects, AMPK activation and p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest in
tumour cells but not in normal tissue. This study reveals that the inhibition of 
autophagy within the epithelium may prevent the development and progression of
colorectal cancer in genetically predisposed patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a growing cause of mortality in developing countries, 
warranting investigation into its etiopathogenesis and earlier diagnosis. Here,
we investigated the fecal metabolic phenotype of patients with advanced
colorectal neoplasia and controls using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy and multivariate modeling. The fecal microbiota composition was
assessed by quantitative real-time PCR as well as Wif-1 methylation levels in
stools, serum, and urine and correlated to the metabolic profile of each patient.
The predictivity of the model was 0.507 (Q(2)Y), and the explained variance was
0.755 (R(2)Y). Patients with advanced colorectal neoplasia demonstrated increased
fecal concentrations of four short-chain fatty acids (valerate, acetate,
propionate, and butyrate) and decreased signals relating to β-glucose, glutamine,
and glutamate. The predictive accuracy of the multivariate (1)H NMR model was
higher than that of the guaiac-fecal occult blood test and the Wif-1 methylation 
test for predicting advanced colorectal neoplasia. Correlation analysis between
fecal metabolites and bacterial profiles revealed strong associations between
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium leptum species with short-chain
fatty acids concentration and inverse correlation between Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii and glucose. These preliminary results suggest that fecal
metabonomics may potentially have a future role in a noninvasive colorectal
screening program and may contribute to our understanding of the role of these
dysregulated molecules in the cross-talk between the host and its bacterial
microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of death worldwide.
Chronic gut inflammation is recognized as a risk factor for tumor development,
including CRC. American ginseng is a very commonly used ginseng species in the
West.
METHODS: A genetically engineered Apc (Min/+) mouse model was used in this study.
We analyzed the saponin composition of American ginseng used in this project, and
evaluated its effects on the progression of high-fat-diet-enhanced CRC
carcinogenesis.
RESULTS: After oral ginseng administration (10-20 mg/kg/d for up to 32 wk),
experimental data showed that, compared with the untreated mice, ginseng very
significantly reduced tumor initiation and progression in both the small
intestine (including the proximal end, middle end, and distal end) and the colon 
(all p < 0.01). This tumor number reduction was more obvious in those mice
treated with a low dose of ginseng. The tumor multiplicity data were supported by
body weight changes and gut tissue histology examinations. In addition,
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that compared
with the untreated group, ginseng very significantly reduced the gene expression 
of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-1β, IL-6, tumor
necrosis factor-α, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in both the small intestine and 
the colon (all p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to link our observed effects to the
actions of the gut microbiome in converting the parent ginsenosides to bioactive 
ginseng metabolites. Our data suggest that American ginseng may have potential
value in CRC chemoprevention.

The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to a variety of chemicals and 
commensal bacteria. Recent studies have shown that changes in gut microbial
populations caused by chlorine or other chemicals in the drinking water influence
the development of human colorectal cancer, although the mechanism of
tumorigenesis in the gut epithelium is obfuscated by the diversity of microflora 
and complexity of the tumor microenvironment. In this regard, mouse models that
recapitulate human colorectal cancer are an invaluable tool. In this study, we
used two conditional adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) knockout mouse models to
investigate the effect of chlorinated water on tumorigenesis in the digestive
tract. Mice with colon-specific carcinoma--caused by either chromosomal (CDX2P
9.5-NLS Cre;Apc(+/flox), abbreviated to CPC;Apc) or microsatellite
(CDX2P9.5-G19Cre;Apc(flox/flox) and CDX2P9.5-G22Cre;Apc(flox/flox)) instability, 
respectively--were administered chlorinated (10.0 mg/L chlorine) or tap (0.7 mg/L
chlorine) water and evaluated for colon polyp formation. In CPC;Apc mice given
chlorinated drinking water, tumors tended to develop in the colon, whereas in
those that drank tap water, tumors were mostly observed in the small intestine.
There was no difference in the rate of tumor formation of
CDX2P9.5-G19Cre;Apc(flox/flox) and CDX2P9.5-G22Cre;Apc(flox/flox) mice consuming 
chlorinated as compared to tap water, suggesting that microsatellite instability 
in the Apc gene does not significantly affect tumorigenesis. Chlorinated water
altered the enteric environment by reducing the fecal populations of the
obligatory anaerobes Clostridium perfringens and C. difficile, as well as species
belonging to the Atopobium cluster, including Enterobacteriaceae and
Staphylococcus sp., which was associated with colon tumorigenesis in CPC;Apc
mice. These results suggest that differences in tumorigenesis among CPC;Apc mice 
consuming chlorinated versus tap water may be due to differences in
gastrointestinal commensal populations.

The Roles of Inflammation, Nutrient Availability and the Commensal Microbiota in 
Enteric Pathogen Infection.

Stecher B.

The healthy human intestine is colonized by as many as 1014 bacteria belonging to
more than 500 different species forming a microbial ecosystem of unsurpassed
diversity, termed the microbiota. The microbiota's various bacterial members
engage in a physiological network of cooperation and competition within several
layers of complexity. Within the last 10 years, technological progress in the
field of next-generation sequencing technologies has tremendously advanced our
understanding of the wide variety of physiological and pathological processes
that are influenced by the commensal microbiota (1, 2). An increasing number of
human disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type 2
diabetes, obesity, allergies and colorectal cancer are linked with altered
microbiota composition (3). Moreover, a clearer picture is emerging of the
composition of the human microbiota in healthy individuals, its variability over 
time and between different persons and how the microbiota is shaped by
environmental factors (i.e., diet) and the host's genetic background (4). A
general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in
the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed
colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be
transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high
levels. This disruption can be caused by exposure to antibiotics (5, 6), changes 
in diet (7, 8), application of probiotics and drugs (9), and a variety of
diseases (3). Breakdown of CR can boost colonization by intrinsic pathogens or
increase susceptibility to infections (10). One consequence of pathogen expansion
is the triggering of inflammatory host responses and pathogen-mediated disease.
Interestingly, human enteric pathogens are part of a small group of bacterial
families that belong to the Proteobacteria: the Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli,
Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.), the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio
cholerae) and the Campylobacteriaceae (Campylobacter spp.). In general, members
of these families (be it commensals or pathogens) only constitute a minority of
the intestinal microbiota. However, proteobacterial "blooms" are a characteristic
trait of an abnormal microbiota such as in the course of antibiotic therapy,
dietary changes or inflammation (11). It has become clear that the gut microbiota
not only plays a major role in priming and regulating mucosal and systemic
immunity, but that the immune system also contributes to host control over
microbiota composition. These two ways of mutual communication between the
microbiota and the immune system were coined as "outside-in" and "inside-out,"
respectively (12). The significance of those interactions for human health is
particularly evident in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The
symptoms of these recurrent, chronic types of gut inflammation are caused by an
excessive immune response against one's own commensal microbiota (13). It is
assumed that deregulated immune responses can be caused by a genetic
predisposition, leading to, for example, the impairment of intestinal barrier
function or disruption of mucosal T-cell homeostasis. In CD or UC patients, an
abnormally composed microbiota, referred to as "dysbiosis," is commonly observed 
(discussed later). This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance
of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at
the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes
Bacteroidia and Clostridia. So far, it is unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or
a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, both scenarios are
equally conceivable. Recent work suggests that inflammatory immune responses in
the gut (both IBD and pathogen-induced) can alter the gut luminal milieu in a way
that favors dysbiosis (14). In this chapter, I present a survey on our current
state of understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms underlying gut
inflammation-associated dysbiosis. The role of dysbiosis in enteric infections
and human IBD is discussed. In addition, I will focus on competition of enteric
pathogens and the gut microbiota in the inflamed gut and the role of dysbiotic
microbiota alterations (e.g., "Enterobacterial blooms" (11)) for the evolution of
pathogenicity.

IMPORTANCE: Evidence indicates a complex link between gut microbiome, immunity,
and intestinal tumorigenesis. To target the microbiota and immunity for
colorectal cancer prevention and therapy, a better understanding of the
relationship between microorganisms and immune cells in the tumor
microenvironment is needed. Experimental evidence suggests that Fusobacterium
nucleatum may promote colonic neoplasia development by downregulating antitumor T
cell-mediated adaptive immunity.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a greater amount of F nucleatum in
colorectal carcinoma tissue is associated with a lower density of T cells in
tumor tissue.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on
598 rectal and colon carcinoma cases in 2 US nationwide prospective cohort
studies with follow-up through 2006, the Nurses' Health Study (participants
enrolled in 1976) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (participants
enrolled in 1986). Tissue collection and processing were performed from 2002
through 2008, and immunity assessment, 2008 through 2009. From 2013 through 2014,
the amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue was measured by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay; we equally dichotomized positive
cases (high vs low). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was
conducted in 2014 to assess associations of the amount of F nucleatum with
densities (quartiles) of T cells in tumor tissue, controlling for clinical and
tumor molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island
methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1)
methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation status. We adjusted the 2-sided 
α level to .013 for multiple hypothesis testing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Densities of CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO (protein tyrosine
phosphatase receptor type C [PTPRC])+, and FOXP3+ T cells in tumor tissue,
determined by means of tissue microarray immunohistochemical analysis and
computer-assisted image analysis.
RESULTS: F nucleatum was detected in colorectal carcinoma tissue in 76 (13%) of
598 cases. Compared with F nucleatum-negative cases, F nucleatum-high cases were 
inversely associated with the density of CD3+ T cells (for a unit increase in
quartile categories of CD3+ T cells as an outcome: multivariable odds ratio, 0.47
[95% CI, 0.26-0.87]; P for trend = .006). The amount of F nucleatum was not
significantly associated with the density of CD8+, CD45RO+, or FOXP3+ T cells (P 
fortrend = .24, .88, and .014, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The amount of tissue F nucleatum is inversely
associated with CD3+ T-cell density in colorectal carcinoma tissue. On
validation, our human population data may provide an impetus for further
investigations on potential interactive roles of Fusobacterium and host immunity 
in colon carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: The human gut microbiome is associated with the development of colon 
cancer, and recent studies have found changes in the microbiome in cancer
patients compared to healthy controls. Studying the microbial communities in the 
tumor microenvironment may shed light on the role of host-bacteria interactions
in colorectal cancer. Here, we highlight the major shifts in the colorectal tumor
microbiome relative to that of matched normal colon tissue from the same
individual, allowing us to survey the microbial communities in the tumor
microenvironment and providing intrinsic control for environmental and host
genetic effects on the microbiome.
METHODS: We sequenced the microbiome in 44 primary tumor and 44 patient-matched
normal colon tissue samples to determine differentially abundant microbial taxa
These data were also used to functionally characterize the microbiome of the
cancer and normal sample pairs and identify functional pathways enriched in the
tumor-associated microbiota.
RESULTS: We find that tumors harbor distinct microbial communities compared to
nearby healthy tissue. Our results show increased microbial diversity in the
tumor microenvironment, with changes in the abundances of commensal and
pathogenic bacterial taxa, including Fusobacterium and Providencia. While
Fusobacterium has previously been implicated in colorectal cancer, Providencia is
a novel tumor-associated agent which has not been identified in previous studies.
Additionally, we identified a clear, significant enrichment of predicted
virulence-associated genes in the colorectal cancer microenvironment, likely
dependent upon the genomes of Fusobacterium and Providencia.
CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies bacterial taxa significantly correlated with
colorectal cancer, including a novel finding of an elevated abundance of
Providencia in the tumor microenvironment. We also describe the predicted
metabolic pathways and enzymes differentially present in the tumor-associated
microbiome, and show an enrichment of virulence-associated bacterial genes in the
tumor microenvironment. This predicted virulence enrichment supports the
hypothesis that the microbiome plays an active role in colorectal cancer
development and/or progression. Our results provide a starting point for future
prognostic and therapeutic research with the potential to improve patient
outcomes.

Cholecystectomy, surgical removal of the gallbladder, changes bile flow to the
intestine and can therefore alter the bidirectional interactions between bile
acids (BAs) and the intestinal microbiota. We quantified and correlated BAs and
bacterial community composition in gallstone patients scheduled for
cholecystectomy before and after the procedure, using gas-liquid chromatography
and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, followed by quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction of the phylum Bacteroidetes. Gallstone patients had higher overall
concentrations of faecal BAs and a decreased microbial diversity, accompanied by 
a reduction in the beneficial genus Roseburia and an enrichment of the
uncultivated genus Oscillospira, compared with controls. These two genera may
thus serve as biomarkers for symptomatic gallstone formation. Oscillospira was
correlated positively with secondary BAs and negatively with primary BAs, while
the phylum Bacteroidetes showed an opposite trend. Cholecystectomy resulted in no
substantial change in patients' faecal BAs. However, bacterial composition was
significantly altered, with a significant increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes.
Given that cholecystectomy has been associated with a higher risk of colorectal
cancer and that members of the Bacteroidetes are increased in that disease,
microbial consequences of cholecystectomy should be further explored.

The microbiome is the collective term used to describe the bacteria, viruses,
fungi and archaea that reside on and in the human body. The majority of these
organisms are found within the large bowel. Mounting evidence suggests that
changes in the microbiome may be associated with the development of colorectal
cancer, a disease which affects 1.3 million people a year worldwide. Using
colorectal cancer as an example, this article presents the inter-specialty
collaborative approach to microbiome research and discusses the key role that
clinical biochemistry is likely to play.

SCOPE: MicroRNAs (miRs) are proposed as colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarkers.
Pomegranate ellagic acid and their microbiota metabolites urolithins exert
anticancer effects in preclinical CRC models, and target normal and malignant
colon tissues in CRC patients. Herein, we investigated whether the intake of
pomegranate extract (PE) modified miRs expression in surgical colon tissues
versus biopsies from CRC patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.
Thirty-five CRC patients consumed 900 mg PE daily before surgery. Control CRC
patients (no PE intake, n = 10) were included. Our results revealed: (1)
significant differences for specific miRs between malignant and normal tissues
modifiable by the surgical protocols; (2) opposed trends between -5p and -3p
isomolecules; (3) general induction of miRs attributable to the surgery; (4)
moderate modulation of various miRs following the PE intake, and (5) no
association between tissue urolithins and the observed miRs changes.
CONCLUSION: PE consumption appears to affect specific colon tissue miRs but
surgery critically alters miRs levels hindering the discrimination of significant
changes caused by dietary factors and the establishment of genuine differences
between malignant and normal tissues as biomarkers. The components responsible
for the PE effects and the clinical relevance of these observations deserve
further research.

A genome-wide systems analysis reveals strong link between colorectal cancer and 
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbial metabolite of dietary meat and
fat.

Xu R, Wang Q, Li L.

BACKGROUND: Dietary intakes of red meat and fat are established risk factors for 
both colorectal cancer (CRC) and cardiovascular disease (CVDs). Recent studies
have shown a mechanistic link between TMAO, an intestinal microbial metabolite of
red meat and fat, and risk of CVDs. Data linking TMAO directly to CRC is,
however, lacking. Here, we present an unbiased data-driven network-based systems 
approach to uncover a potential genetic relationship between TMAO and CRC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed two different epigenetic interaction
networks (EINs) using chemical-gene, disease-gene and protein-protein interaction
data from multiple large-scale data resources. We developed a network-based
ranking algorithm to ascertain TMAO-related diseases from EINs. We systematically
analyzed disease categories among TMAO-related diseases at different ranking
cutoffs. We then determined which genetic pathways were associated with both TMAO
and CRC.
RESULTS: We show that CVDs and their major risk factors were ranked highly among 
TMAO-related diseases, confirming the newly discovered mechanistic link between
CVDs and TMAO, and thus validating our algorithms. CRC was ranked highly among
TMAO-related disease retrieved from both EINs (top 0.02%, #1 out of 4,372
diseases retrieved based on Mendelian genetics and top 10.9% among 882 diseases
based on genome-wide association genetics), providing strong supporting evidence 
for our hypothesis that TMAO is genetically related to CRC. We have also
identified putative genetic pathways that may link TMAO to CRC, which warrants
further investigation. Through systematic disease enrichment analysis, we also
demonstrated that TMAO is related to metabolic syndromes and cancers in general.
CONCLUSIONS: Our genome-wide analysis demonstrates that systems approaches to
studying the epigenetic interactions among diet, microbiome metabolisms, and
disease genetics hold promise for understanding disease pathogenesis. Our results
show that TMAO is genetically associated with CRC. This study suggests that TMAO 
may be an important intermediate marker linking dietary meat and fat and gut
microbiota metabolism to risk of CRC, underscoring opportunities for the
development of new gut microbiome-dependent diagnostic tests and therapeutics for
CRC.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Mutations in the
innate immune sensor AIM2 are frequently identified in patients with colorectal
cancer, but how AIM2 modulates colonic tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we found
that Aim2-deficient mice were hypersusceptible to colonic tumor development.
Production of inflammasome-associated cytokines and other inflammatory mediators 
was largely intact in Aim2-deficient mice; however, intestinal stem cells were
prone to uncontrolled proliferation. Aberrant Wnt signaling expanded a population
of tumor-initiating stem cells in the absence of AIM2. Susceptibility of
Aim2-deficient mice to colorectal tumorigenesis was enhanced by a dysbiotic gut
microbiota, which was reduced by reciprocal exchange of gut microbiota with
healthy wild-type mice. These findings uncover a synergy between a specific host 
genetic factor and gut microbiota in determining the susceptibility to colorectal
cancer. Therapeutic modulation of AIM2 expression and microbiota has the
potential to prevent colorectal cancer.

Epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk
with high red meat (HRM) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be
protective. In the present study, we examined whether a HRM diet increased rectal
O(6)-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (O(6)MeG) adduct levels in healthy human subjects,
and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (HAMSB) was protective. A group
of twenty-three individuals consumed 300 g/d of cooked red meat without (HRM
diet) or with 40 g/d of HAMSB (HRM+HAMSB diet) over 4-week periods separated by a
4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. Stool and rectal biopsy samples
were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at
baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. The HRM diet
increased rectal O(6)MeG adducts relative to its baseline by 21% (P < 0.01),
whereas the addition of HAMSB to the HRM diet prevented this increase. Epithelial
proliferation increased with both the HRM (P < 0.001) and HRM + HAMSB (P < 0.05) 
diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower
following the HRM + HAMSB diet compared with the HRM diet (P < 0.05). Relative to
its baseline, the HRM + HAMSB diet increased the excretion of SCFA by over 20% (P
< 0.05) and increased the absolute abundances of the Clostridium coccoides group 
(P < 0.05), the Clostridium leptum group (P < 0.05), Lactobacillus spp. (P <
0.01), Parabacteroides distasonis (P < 0.001) and Ruminococcus bromii (P < 0.05),
but lowered Ruminococcus torques (P < 0.05) and the proportions of Ruminococcus
gnavus, Ruminococcus torques and Escherichia coli (P < 0.01). HRM consumption
could increase the risk of CRC through increased formation of colorectal
epithelial O(6)MeG adducts. HAMSB consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct
formation, which may be associated with increased stool SCFA levels and/or
changes in the microbiota composition.

Uncured and nitrite-cured pork were subjected, raw, cooked (65 °C, 15 min) or
overcooked (90 °C, 30 min), to an in vitro digestion model, which includes mouth,
stomach, duodenum, and colon phases. Heating of uncured meat resulted in a
pronounced increase in lipid and protein oxidation products throughout digestion.
Nitrite-curing had an antioxidant effect during digestion, but this effect
disappeared when the meat was overcooked, resulting in up to ninefold higher
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal concentrations compared with digested nitrite-cured raw and
cooked pork. Colonic digesta contained significantly higher concentrations of the
NOC-specific DNA adduct O(6)-carboxy-methylguanine when pork underwent a more
intense heating procedure, independent of nitrite-curing, depending strongly on
the fecal inoculum used. Since processed meats are usually nitrite-cured, the
present study suggests that overcooking processed meat is likely to result in the
formation of genotoxic compounds during digestion and should, therefore, be
avoided.

Members of the human microbiota are increasingly being correlated to human health
and disease states, but the majority of the underlying microbial metabolites that
regulate host-microbe interactions remain largely unexplored. Select strains of
Escherichia coli present in the human colon have been linked to the initiation of
inflammation-induced colorectal cancer through an unknown small-molecule-mediated
process. The responsible non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide hybrid pathway encodes 
'colibactin', which belongs to a largely uncharacterized family of small
molecules. Genotoxic small molecules from this pathway that are capable of
initiating cancer formation have remained elusive due to their high instability. 
Guided by metabolomic analyses, here we employ a combination of NMR spectroscopy 
and bioinformatics-guided isotopic labelling studies to characterize the
colibactin warhead, an unprecedented substituted spirobicyclic structure. The
warhead crosslinks duplex DNA in vitro, providing direct experimental evidence
for colibactin's DNA-damaging activity. The data support unexpected models for
both colibactin biosynthesis and its mode of action.

Obesity is a fast-emerging epidemic in the Asia-Pacific region, with numbers
paralleling the rising global prevalence within the past 30 years. The landscape 
of gut diseases in Asia has been drastically changed by obesity. In addition to
more non-specific abdominal symptoms, obesity is the cause of gastro-oesophageal 
reflux disease, various gastrointestinal cancers (colorectal cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia
adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer and gallbladder cancer) and non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease. Abnormal cross-talk between the gut microbiome and the obese host 
seems to play a central role in the pathogenesis, but more studies are needed.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world and the
second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US and Spain. The molecular
mechanisms involved in the etiology of CRC are not yet elucidated due in part to 
the complexity of the human gut microbiota. In this study, we compared the
microbiome composition of 90 tumor and matching adjacent tissue (adjacent) from
cohorts from the US and Spain by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in order to
determine the impact of the geographic origin on the CRC microbiome. Data showed 
a significantly (P < 0.05) higher Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) for the US (PD
Adjacent = 26.3 ± 5.3, PD Tumor = 23.3 ± 6.2) compared to the Spanish cohort (PD 
Adjacent = 18.9 ± 5.9, PD Tumor = 18.7 ± 6.6) while no significant differences in
bacterial diversity were observed between tumor and adjacent tissues for
individuals from the same country. Adjacent tissues from the Spanish cohort were 
enriched in Firmicutes (SP = 43.9% and US = 22.2%, P = 0.0001) and Actinobacteria
(SP = 1.6% and US = 0.5%, P = 0.0018) compared to US adjacent tissues, while
adjacent tissues from the US had significantly higher abundances of Fusobacteria 
(US = 8.1% and SP = 1.5%, P = 0.0023) and Sinergistetes (US = 0.3% and SP = 0.1%,
P = 0.0097). Comparisons between tumor and adjacent tissues in each cohort
identified the genus Eikenella significantly over represented in US tumors (T =
0.024% and A = 0%, P = 0.03), and the genera Fusobacterium (T = 10.4% and A =
1.5%, P = <0.0001), Bulleida (T = 0.36% and A = 0.09%, P = 0.02), Gemella (T =
1.46% and A = 0.19%, P = 0.03), Parvimonas (T = 3.14% and A = 0.86%, P = 0.03),
Campylobacter (T = 0.15% and A = 0.008%, P = 0.047), and Streptococcus (T = 2.84%
and A = 2.19%, P = 0.05) significantly over represented in Spanish tumors.
Predicted metagenome functional content from 16S rRNA surveys showed that
bacterial motility proteins and proteins involved in flagellar assembly were over
represented in adjacent tissues of both cohorts, while pathways involved in fatty
acid biosynthesis, the MAPK signaling pathway, and bacterial toxins were over
represented in tumors. Our study suggests that microbiome compositional and
functional dissimilarities by geographic location should be taken in
consideration when approaching CRC therapeutic options.

Modification of microflora imbalance: future directions for prevention and
treatment of colorectal cancer?

Ciernikova S, Mego M, Hainova K, Adamcikova Z, Stevurkova V, Zajac V.

Increasing incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer brings the necessity to
uncover new possibilities in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The
microbiome as the collective genetic material of the microflora, overexceed the
number of genes in the human genome and is unique for each individual. Due to the
benefits providing for the host and mainly for immediate interaction with the
host immune system, a gastrointestinal microflora can be considered "cardinal
microbiome". Host-microbial relations includes symbiotic, pathogenic and
competitive interactions. Causal role of gastrointestinal microflora in
colorectal carcinogenesis is still not well determined. This minireview is
focused on current evidence in understanding the role of bacteria in colorectal
carcinogenesis, the impact of bacterial dysbiosis on tumor formation, and ability
of probiotics and bacterial vectors to modulate the gastrointestinal microflora
as prevention and therapy tool in colorectal cancer.

Chemotherapy increases the overall survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. 
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) remains as a drug of first choice in CRC therapy over the
last four decades. However, only 10-15% of patients with advanced CRC respond
positively to 5-FU monotherapy. Therefore, new strategies to enhance the 5-FU
effectiveness, overcome the tumor cell resistance and decrease the unspecific
toxicity are critically needed. Urolithin A (Uro-A) is the main metabolite
produced by the human gut microbiota from the dietary polyphenol ellagic acid.
Uro-A targets the colonic mucosa of CRC patients, and preclinical studies have
shown the anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive activities of this
metabolite. We evaluated here whether Uro-A, at concentrations achievable in the 
human colorectum, could sensitize colon cancer cells to 5-FU and 5'DFUR (a
pro-drug intermediate of 5-FU). We found that both 5-FU and 5'DFUR arrested the
cell cycle at the S phase by regulating cyclins A and B1 in the human colon
cancer cells Caco-2, SW-480 and HT-29, and also triggered apoptosis through the
activation of caspases 8 and 9. Co-treatments with Uro-A decreased IC50 values
for both 5-FU and 5'DFUR and additionally arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M
phase together with a slight increase in caspases 8 and 9 activation. Overall, we
show that Uro-A potentiated the effects of both 5-FU and 5'DFUR on colon cancer
cells. This suggests the need for lower 5-FU doses to achieve similar effects,
which could reduce possible adverse effects. Further in vivo investigations are
warranted to explore the possible role of Uro-A as a chemotherapy adjuvant.

PURPOSE: Gut microbiota has been postulated to serve as a significant promoter of
CRC formation, and colonic dysbiosis was previously reported in CRC tissue. Our
aim was to evaluate the association between the type and cumulative duration of
antibiotic exposure and CRC risk.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study using a large population-based 
database from the UK. Cases were defined as those with any medical code of CRC.
Subjects with known familial CRC syndromes or IBD were excluded from the study.
For every case, four eligible controls matched on age, sex, practice site, and
duration of follow-up before index date were selected using incidence-density
sampling. Exposure of interest was antibiotic therapy before index date. Adjusted
ORs and 95%CIs were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 20,990 cases and 82,054 controls were identified. The
adjusted OR for CRC among subjects first exposed to penicillins >10 years prior
to index date was 1.11 (95%CI 1.02-1.20). The risk increased significantly with
the number of penicillin exposures up to 1.20 (95%CI 1.11-1.31) for >10 courses. 
The risk also increased with the average number of penicillin treatments per-year
(exposure intensity) with an OR of 1.04 (95%CI 1.01-1.08) per one additional
treatment per year. Exposure to anti-viral or anti-fungal therapy was not
associated with CRC risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Past exposure to multiple courses of penicillins is related to a
modest elevation in CRC risk.

Chikungunya's phenomenal dissemination imposes now infection suspicion when
returning from endemic areas. Colorectal cancer screening may be dependent of the
microbiome. Even a small amount of E. coli in catheter sampled urine is
predictive for a urinary infection. Prevention of pharyngitis suppurated late
complications doesn't justify systematic antimicrobial therapy. A bitherapy is
probably better for severe community acquired pneumonias. Due to epidemiology and
resistances, management of gonorrhoea has changed. Enterovirus 68 is particular
because of its almost exclusive lung tropism in children. The question is no
longer how to treat hepatitis C but which patients to treat and when. Pritelivir 
clearly improves herpes genitalis symptoms. The first confirmed case of Ebola has
reach our contry.

Recently, bacterial infection causing periodontal disease has attracted
considerable attention as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Fusobacterium
species is an oral bacterial group of the human microbiome. Some evidence
suggests that Fusobacterium species promote colorectal cancer development;
however, no previous studies have reported the association between Fusobacterium 
species and pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we examined whether Fusobacterium
species exist in pancreatic cancer tissue. Using a database of 283 patients with 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we tested cancer tissue specimens for
Fusobacterium species. We also tested the specimens for KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and
PIK3CA mutations and measured microRNA-21 and microRNA-31. In addition, we
assessed epigenetic alterations, including CpG island methylator phenotype
(CIMP). Our data showed an 8.8% detection rate of Fusobacterium species in
pancreatic cancers; however, tumor Fusobacterium status was not associated with
any clinical and molecular features. In contrast, in multivariate Cox regression 
analysis, compared with the Fusobacterium species-negative group, we observed
significantly higher cancer-specific mortality rates in the positive group (p =
0.023). In conclusion, Fusobacterium species were detected in pancreatic cancer
tissue. Tumor Fusobacterium species status is independently associated with a
worse prognosis of pancreatic cancer, suggesting that Fusobacterium species may
be a prognostic biomarker of pancreatic cancer.

States.

AIM: To investigate differences in microbes and short chain fatty acid (SCFA)
levels in stool samples from Hispanic and non-Hispanic African American, American
Indian, and White participants.
METHODS: Stool samples from twenty participants were subjected to analysis for
relative levels of viable bacteria and for SCFA levels. Additionally, the samples
were subjected to 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing for identification of bacteria
present in the stool. We used a metagenome functional prediction technique to
analyze genome copy numbers and estimate the abundance of butyrate kinase in all 
samples.
RESULTS: We found that African Americans had significantly lower levels of
acetate, butyrate, and total SCFAs than all other racial/ethnic groups. We also
found that participant microbial profiles differed by racial/ethnic group.
African Americans had significantly more Firmicutes than Whites, with enriched
Ruminococcaceae. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was also significantly higher
for African Americans than for Whites (P = 0.049). We found Clostridium levels to
be significantly and inversely related to total SCFA levels (P = 0.019) and we
found Bacteroides to be positively associated (P = 0.027) and Clostridium to be
negatively associated (P = 0.012) with levels of butyrate. We also identified a
correlation between copy number for a butyrate kinase predicted from 16S rRNA
gene abundance and levels of butyrate in stool.
CONCLUSION: The identified differences in gut flora and SCFA levels may relate to
colorectal cancer mortality differentials and may be useful as targets for future
clinical and behavioral interventions.

Colorectal cancer, a commonly diagnosed cancer in the elderly, often develops
slowly from benign polyps called adenoma. The gut microbiota is believed to be
directly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The identity and functional
capacity of the adenoma- or carcinoma-related gut microbe(s), however, have not
been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Here we perform a metagenome-wide
association study (MGWAS) on stools from advanced adenoma and carcinoma patients 
and from healthy subjects, revealing microbial genes, strains and functions
enriched in each group. An analysis of potential risk factors indicates that high
intake of red meat relative to fruits and vegetables appears to associate with
outgrowth of bacteria that might contribute to a more hostile gut environment.
These findings suggest that faecal microbiome-based strategies may be useful for 
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal adenoma or carcinoma.

OBJECTIVES: The appendix may modulate colon microbiota and bowel inflammation. We
investigated whether appendectomy alters colorectal cancer risk.
METHODS: We identified a cohort of 75,979 patients who underwent appendectomy
between 1997 and 1999 based on the insurance claims of Taiwan. A comparison
cohort of 303,640 persons without appendectomy was selected randomly, frequency
matched by age, sex, comorbidity and entry year was also selected. We monitored
subsequent colorectal cancer development in both cohorts.
RESULTS: The overall colorectal cancer incidence was 14% higher in the
appendectomy patients than in the comparison cohort (p <0.05): the highest
incidence was observed for rectal cancer, and the lowest incidence was observed
for cancer of the cecum-ascending colon for both cohorts. Men were at higher risk
than women. Subjects ≥ 60 years had an HR of 12.8 compared to those <60 years.
The incidence of colorectal cancer was much higher in 1.5-3.5 years post
appendectomy follow-up than for the comparisons (HR of 2.13). Patients who
received an incidental appendectomy had an HR of 2.90 when compared to the
comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of our study suggest that appendectomy in patients with
appendicitis is likely associated with the development of colorectal cancer in
the post-surgery period.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major burden of public health and
healthcare worldwide. Microbiota has been suggested in promoting chronic
inflammation in the intestine which, in turn, promotes tumor development. This
study focuses on possible correlations of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
with proinflammatory Stat3 signaling activities and the resulting levels of its
downstream proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 in CRC patients.
METHODS: HPV was examined using HPV Genotyping Chip technology and constitutively
active Stat3 (p-Stat3) and IL-17 levels were tested using immunohistochemistry
(IHC) in paraffin-embedded cancerous and adjacent normal tissues (ANT) from a
cohort of 95 CRC patients. Correlation analyses were performed between HPV
infection and clinicopathological characteristics, Stat3 activities and IL-17
levels among these CRC patients.
RESULTS: Three major findings were observed: (1) HPV infection existed in a high 
rate of CRC cases (48.4%, 46/95), of which 45 cases (45/46, 97.8%) were high-risk
HPV16-positive and only one case was HPV53-positive. (2) HPV infection correlated
with poorer clinical stages (III+IV) of CRC. (3) HPV infection strongly
correlated with both constitutively higher Stat3 activities (P<0.01) and higher
IL-17 levels (P<0.01) only in CRC tissues but not in ANT tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV infection is common in CRC patients suggesting potentially
preventive effectiveness of HPV vaccination among high-risk young individuals. We
have for the first time revealed a tri-lateral relationship among HPV infection, 
constitutive Stat3 activity and IL-17 level, whose collaborative act may
orchestrate a proinflammatory microenvironment in the colorectum that, in turn,
may promote carcinogenesis and possibly facilitate progression of CRC.

The dysbiosis of the human intestinal microbiota is linked to sporadic colorectal
carcinoma (CRC). The present study was designed to investigate the gut microbiota
distribution features in CRC patients. We performed pyrosequencing based analysis
of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region to investigate microbiota of the cancerous tissue 
and adjacent non-cancerous normal tissue in proximal and distal CRC samples. The 
results revealed that the microbial structures of the CRC patients and healthy
individuals differed significantly. Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were
over-represented whereas Proteobacteria was under-represented in CRC patients. In
addition, Lactococcus and Fusobacterium exhibited a relatively higher abundance
while Pseudomonas and Escherichia-Shigella was reduced in cancerous tissues
compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Meanwhile, the overall microbial
structures of proximal and distal colon cancerous tissues were similar; but
certain potential pro-oncogenic pathogens were different. These results suggested
that the mucosa-associated microbiota is dynamically associated with CRC, which
may provide evidences for microbiota-associated diagnostic, prognostic,
preventive, and therapeutic strategies for CRC.

Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in disease, including many cancer
types, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Because germline and somatic
mutations in the genes that are responsible for DNA methylation are infrequent in
malignancies, additional mechanisms must be considered. Mycoplasmas spp.,
including Mycoplasma hyorhinis, efficiently colonize human cells and may serve as
a vehicle for delivery of enzymatically active microbial proteins into the
intracellular milieu. Here, we performed, for the first time, genome-wide and
individual gene mapping of methylation marks generated by the M. hyorhinis CG-
and GATC-specific DNA cytosine methyltransferases (MTases) in human cells. Our
results demonstrated that, upon expression in human cells, MTases readily
translocated to the cell nucleus. In the nucleus, MTases selectively and
efficiently methylated the host genome at the DNA sequence sites free from
pre-existing endogenous methylation, including those in a variety of
cancer-associated genes. We also established that mycoplasma is widespread in
colorectal cancers, suggesting that either the infection contributed to
malignancy onset or, alternatively, that tumors provide a favorable environment
for mycoplasma growth. In the human genome, ∼ 11% of GATC sites overlap with CGs 
(e.g., CGAT(m)CG); therefore, the methylated status of these sites can be
perpetuated by human DNMT1. Based on these results, we now suggest that the
GATC-specific methylation represents a novel type of infection-specific
epigenetic mark that originates in human cells with a previous exposure to
infection. Overall, our findings unveil an entirely new panorama of interactions 
between the human microbiome and epigenome with a potential impact in disease
etiology.

Heat-stabilized rice bran (SRB) has been shown to regulate blood lipids and
glucose, modulate gut mucosal immunity and inhibit colorectal cancer in animal
and human studies. However, SRB's effects on gut microbial composition and
metabolism and the resulting implications for health remain largely unknown. A
pilot, randomized-controlled trial was developed to investigate the effects of
eating 30 g/day SRB on the stool microbiome and metabolome. Seven healthy
participants consumed a study meal and snack daily for 28 days. The microbiome
and metabolome were characterized using 454 pyrosequencing and gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at baseline, two and four weeks
post-intervention. Increases in eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs),
including three from Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus genera, were observed after
two and four weeks of SRB consumption (p<0.01). Branched chain fatty acids,
secondary bile acids and eleven other putative microbial metabolites were
significantly elevated in the SRB group after four weeks. The largest metabolite 
change was a rice bran component, indole-2-carboxylic acid, which showed a mean
12% increase with SRB consumption. These data support the feasibility of dietary 
SRB intervention in adults and support that SRB consumption can affect gut
microbial metabolism. These findings warrant future investigations of larger
cohorts evaluating SRB's effects on intestinal health.

The gut microbiota has an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Dejea and
colleagues have demonstrated that particular bacterial biofilms are associated
with proximal CRC, correlating with changes in tissue biology associated with
oncogenesis. These findings provide a fresh perspective on the microbiota in
cancer: microbial organization might provide critical insight into understanding 
CRC development.

Although predominantly associated with health benefits, the gut microbiota has
also been shown to harbor genes that promote inflammation. In this work, we
report a method for the direct detection and quantification of these
pro-inflammatory bacterial genes by PCR and qPCR in DNA extracted from human
stool samples. PCR reactions were performed to detect (i) the pks island genes,
(ii) tcpC, which is present in some strains of Escherichia coli and (iii) gelE
presented in some strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Additionally, we screened for
the presence of the following genes encoding cyclomodulins that disrupted
mammalian cell division: (iv) cdt (which encodes the cytolethal distending toxin)
and (v) cnf-1 (which encodes the cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1). Our results
show that 20% of the samples (N = 41) tested positive for detectable amounts of
pks island genes, whereas 10% of individuals were positive for tcpC or gelE and
only one individual was found to harbor the cnf-1 gene. Of the 13 individuals
that were positive for at least one of the pro-inflammatory genes, 5 were found
to harbor more than one. A quantitative version of the assay, which used
real-time PCR, revealed the pro-inflammatory genes to be in high copy numbers: up
to 1.3 million copies per mg of feces for the pks island genes. Direct detection 
of specific genes in stool could prove useful toward screening for the presence
of pro-inflammatory bacterial genes in individuals with inflammatory bowel
diseases or colorectal cancer.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of protopanaxadiol (PPD), a gut
microbiome induced ginseng metabolite, in increasing the anticancer effects of a 
chemotherapeutic agent fluorouracil (5-FU) on colorectal cancer. An in vitro
HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell proliferation test was conducted to observe the
effects of PPD, 5-FU and their co-administration and the related mechanisms of
action. Then, an in vivo xenografted athymic mouse model was used to confirm the 
in vitro data. Our results showed that the human gut microbiome converted
ginsenoside compound K to PPD as a metabolite. PPD and 5-FU significantly
inhibited HCT-116 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner (both
p<0.01), and the effects of 5-FU were very significantly enhanced by combined
treatment with PPD (p<0.01). Cell cycle evaluation demonstrated that 5-FU
markedly induced the cancer cell S phase arrest, while PPD increased arrest in G1
phase. Compared to the control, 5-FU and PPD increased apoptosis, and their
co-administration significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells (p<0.01).
Using bioluminescence imaging, in vivo data revealed that 5-FU significantly
reduced the tumor growth up to Day 20 (p<0.05). PPD and 5-FU co-administration
very significantly reduced the tumor size in a dose-related manner (p<0.01
compared to the 5-FU alone). The quantification of the tumor size and weight
changes for 43 days supported the in vivo imaging data. Our results demonstrated 
that the co-administration of PPD and 5-FU significantly inhibited the tumor
growth, indicating that PPD significantly enhanced the anticancer action of 5-FU,
a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent. PPD may have a clinical value in 5-FU's
cancer therapeutics.

Prebiotics are ingredients selectively fermented by the intestinal microbiota
that promote changes in the microbial community structure and/or their
metabolism, conferring health benefits to the host. Studies show that β (1-4)
galacto-oligosaccharides [β (1-4) GOS], lactulose and fructo-oligosaccharides
increase intestinal concentration of lactate and short chain fatty acids, and
stool frequency and weight, and they decrease fecal concentration of secondary
bile acids, fecal pH, and nitroreductase and β-glucuronidase activities
suggesting a clear role in colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. This review
summarizes research on prebiotics bioassimilation, specifically β (1-4) GOS, and 
their potential role in CRC. We also evaluate research that show that the impact 
of prebiotics on host physiology can be direct or through modulation of the gut
intestinal microbiome, specifically the probiome (autochtonous beneficial
bacteria), we present studies on a potential role in CRC progression to finally
describe the current state of β (1-4) GOS generation for industrial production.

Understanding the complex pathophysiology of colorectal cancer and the
interaction between host genetics, the gut microbiome, and diet has attracted
significant attention in the last few years. The discovery that gut microbial
metabolites may dictate the course of colorectal cancer progression supports the 
development of microbial-targeted strategies.

Escherichia coli strains of phylogenetic group B2 and D and bacteriocin
production are associated with advanced colorectal neoplasia.

Kohoutova D, Smajs D, Moravkova P, Cyrany J, Moravkova M, Forstlova M, Cihak M,
Rejchrt S, Bures J.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common cancer worldwide and
the Czech Republic has the 6th highest incidence of CRC worldwide. Large
intestinal microbiota play in its etiopathogenesis important role. Bacteriocins
are proteins, produced by bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family. The aim of
our prospective study was to assess the colonization of large intestinal mucosa
by Escherichia coli strains and to investigate their bacteriocin production.
METHODS: A total of 30 consecutive patients with colorectal adenoma, CRA (17 men,
13 women, aged 39-79, mean age 63 ± 9), 30 patients with CRC (23 men, 7 women,
aged 38-86, mean age 67 ± 11) and 20 healthy controls (9 men, 11 women, age
23-84, mean age 55 ± 15) were enrolled into prospective study. Mucosal biopsies
were taken in the caecum, transverse colon and rectum during pancolonoscopy.
Microbiological culture, isolation and identification of bacteria followed.
Bacteriocin production was assessed by growth inhibition of indicator strains E. 
coli K12-Row, E. coli C6 (phi), and Shigella sonnei 17. Identification of
bacteriocin-encoding determinants and E. coli phylogroups was performed using PCR
methods.
RESULTS: A total of 622 strains were isolated and further investigated. A
significantly higher frequency of simultaneous production of colicins and
microcins was revealed in the group of patients with CRC, when compared to
patients with CRA, p = 0.031. A significantly higher frequency of E. coli
phylogroup D was found in patients with CRC, when compared to controls,
p = 0.044. A significantly higher prevalence of bacteriocinogeny was confirmed in
patients with advanced adenoma when compared to patients with non-advanced
adenoma, p = 0.010. Increasing bacteriocinogeny was associated with an increasing
stage of CRC (assessed according to TNM classification). Either E. coli
phylogroup B2 or E. coli phylogroup D were isolated in biopsies of patients with 
right-sided CRC. A statistically higher incidence of E. coli phylogroup B2 was
found in patients with right-sided CRC when compared to patients with left-sided 
CRC, p = 0.028.
CONCLUSIONS: Large intestinal mucosa of patients with more advanced colorectal
neoplasia is colonized with more virulent strains of E. coli and higher
production of bacteriocins is observed in these patients when compared to those
with less advanced colorectal neoplasia.

Bioactive compounds produced by gut microbial tannase: implications for
colorectal cancer development.

and Nutrition - Spanish National Research Council (ICTAN-CSIC), Madrid Spain.

The microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract have a profound influence 
on the transformation of food into metabolites which can impact human health.
Gallic acid (GA) and pyrogallol (PG) are bioactive compounds displaying diverse
biological properties, including carcinogenic inhibiting activities. However, its
concentration in fruits and vegetables is generally low. These metabolites can be
also generated as final products of tannin metabolism by microbes endowed with
tannase, which opens up the possibility of their anti-cancer potential being
increased. Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) display an imbalanced gut
microbiota respect to healthy population. The recent use of next generation
sequencing technologies has greatly improved knowledge of the identity of
bacterial species that colonize non-tumorous and tumorous tissues of CRC
patients. This information provides a unique opportunity to shed light on the
role played by gut microorganisms in the different stages of this disease. We
here review the recently published gut microbiome associated to CRC patients and 
highlight tannase as an underlying gene function of bacterial species that
selectively colonize tumorous tissues, but not adjacent non-malignant tissues.
Given the anti-carcinogenic roles of GA and PG produced by gut tannin-degrading
bacteria, we provide an overview of the possible consequences of this intriguing 
coincidence for CRC development.

Antibiotic suppression of intestinal microbiota reduces heme-induced
lipoperoxidation associated with colon carcinogenesis in rats.

Epidemiological studies show that heme iron from red meat is associated with
increased colorectal cancer risk. In carcinogen-induced-rats, a heme iron-rich
diet increases the number of precancerous lesions and raises associated fecal
biomarkers. Heme-induced lipoperoxidation measured by fecal thiobarbituric acid
reagents (TBARs) could explain the promotion of colon carcinogenesis by heme.
Using a factorial design we studied if microbiota could be involved in
heme-induced carcinogenesis, by modulating peroxidation. Rats treated or not with
an antibiotic cocktail were given a control or a hemoglobin-diet. Fecal bacteria 
were counted on agar and TBARs concentration assayed in fecal water. The
suppression of microbiota by antibiotics was associated with a reduction of crypt
height and proliferation and with a cecum enlargement, which are characteristics 
of germ-free rats. Rats given hemoglobin diets had increased fecal TBARs, which
were suppressed by the antibiotic treatment. A duplicate experiment in rats given
dietary hemin yielded similar results. These data show that the intestinal
microbiota is involved in enhancement of lipoperoxidation by heme iron. We thus
suggest that microbiota could play a role in the heme-induced promotion of
colorectal carcinogenesis.

Wheat bran extract (WBE), containing arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides that are
potential prebiotic substrates, has been shown to modify bacterial colonic
fermentation in human subjects and to beneficially affect the development of
colorectal cancer (CRC) in rats. However, it is unclear whether these changes in 
fermentation are able to reduce the risk of developing CRC in humans. The aim of 
the present study was to evaluate the effects of WBE on the markers of CRC risk
in healthy volunteers, and to correlate these effects with colonic fermentation. 
A total of twenty healthy subjects were enrolled in a double-blind, cross-over,
randomised, controlled trial in which the subjects ingested WBE (10 g/d) or
placebo (maltodextrin, 10 g/d) for 3 weeks, separated by a 3-week washout period.
At the end of each study period, colonic handling of NH3 was evaluated using the 
biomarker lactose[15N, 15N']ureide, colonic fermentation was characterised
through a metabolomics approach, and the predominant microbial composition was
analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. As markers of CRC risk,
faecal water genotoxicity was determined using the comet assay and faecal water
cytotoxicity using a colorimetric cell viability assay. Intake of WBE induced a
shift from urinary to faecal 15N excretion, indicating a stimulation of colonic
bacterial activity and/or growth. Microbial analysis revealed a selective
stimulation of Bifidobacterium adolescentis. In addition, WBE altered the colonic
fermentation pattern and significantly reduced colonic protein fermentation
compared with the run-in period. However, faecal water cytotoxicity and
genotoxicity were not affected. Although intake of WBE clearly affected colonic
fermentation and changed the composition of the microbiota, these changes were
not associated with the changes in the markers of CRC risk.

Environmental factors clearly affect colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence, but the
mechanisms through which these factors function are unknown. One prime candidate 
is an altered colonic microbiota. Here we show that the mucosal microbiota
organization is a critical factor associated with a subset of CRC. We identified 
invasive polymicrobial bacterial biofilms (bacterial aggregates), structures
previously associated with nonmalignant intestinal pathology, nearly universally 
(89%) on right-sided tumors (13 of 15 CRCs, 4 of 4 adenomas) but on only 12% of
left-sided tumors (2 of 15 CRCs, 0 of 2 adenomas). Surprisingly, patients with
biofilm-positive tumors, whether cancers or adenomas, all had biofilms on their
tumor-free mucosa far distant from their tumors. Bacterial biofilms were
associated with diminished colonic epithelial cell E-cadherin and enhanced
epithelial cell IL-6 and Stat3 activation, as well as increased crypt epithelial 
cell proliferation in normal colon mucosa. High-throughput sequencing revealed no
consistent bacterial genus associated with tumors, regardless of biofilm status. 
However, principal coordinates analysis revealed that biofilm communities on
paired normal mucosa, distant from the tumor itself, cluster with tumor
microbiomes as opposed to biofilm-negative normal mucosa bacterial communities
also from the tumor host. Colon mucosal biofilm detection may predict increased
risk for development of sporadic CRC.

The bacterial genotoxin colibactin promotes colon tumor growth by modifying the
tumor microenvironment.

The gut microbiota is suspected to promote colorectal cancer (CRC). Escherichia
coli are more frequently found in CCR biopsies than in healthy mucosa;
furthermore, the majority of mucosa-associated E. coli isolated from CCR harbors 
the pks genomic island (pks+ E. coli) that is responsible for the synthesis of
colibactin, a genotoxic compound. We have recently reported that transient
contact of a few malignant cells with colibactin-producing E. coli increases
tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Growth is sustained by cellular
senescence that is accompanied by the production of growth factors. We
demonstrated that cellular senescence is a consequence of the pks+ E.
coli-induced alteration of p53 SUMOylation, an essential post-translational
modification in eukaryotic cells. The underlying mechanisms for this process
involve the induction of miR-20a-5p expression, which targets SENP1, a key
protein in the regulation of the SUMOylation process. These results are
consistent with the expression of SENP1, miR-20a-5p and growth factors that are
observed in a CRC mouse model and in human CCR biopsies colonized by pks+ E.
coli. Overall, the data reveal a new paradigm for carcinogenesis in which pks+ E.
coli infection induces cellular senescence characterized by the production of
growth factors that promote the proliferation of uninfected cells and,
subsequently, tumor growth.

Natural products and chemotherapeutic agents on cancer: prevention vs. treatment.

60637, USA.

Natural products play an important role in cancer therapeutics, and lately more
attentions have been paid to the prevention of major lethal malignancies, such as
colorectal cancer (CRC). After oral ingestion, botanicals' parent compounds can
be converted to their metabolites by the enteric microbiome, and these
metabolites may have different bioactivities and variable bioavailability. In
this study, we used an active ginseng metabolite, protopanaxadiol (PPD), as an
example to assess its colon cancer preventive effect by comparing its effect with
the treatment effect of fluorouracil (5-FU). A xenograft tumor nude mouse model
with human colon cancer cell inoculation was used. After preventive PPD or
treatment 5-FU administration with the same dose (30 mg/kg), tumor growth
inhibition was evaluated by both a Xenogen bioluminescence imaging technique and 
manual tumor size measurement. Our data showed that preventive PPD very
significantly inhibited the tumor growth compared to 5-FU (p < 0.01). Our data
suggest that the PPD is a promising cancer prevention agent. More studies are
needed to explore the chemopreventive actions of PPD and its potential clinical
utility.

Dietary composition has an important role in shaping the gut microbiota. In turn,
changes in the diet directly impinge on bacterial metabolites present in the
intestinal lumen. Whether such metabolites play a role in intestinal cancer has
been a topic of hot debate. In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Donohoe and
colleagues show that dietary fiber protects against colorectal carcinoma in a
microbiota-dependent manner. Furthermore, fiber-derived butyrate acts as a
histone deacetylase inhibitor, inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing
apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells experiencing the Warburg effect.

The human body normally lives in symbiosis with a considerable microscopic
environment present on all interfaces with the external environment; it hosts ten
times more microbes (microbiota) that it has somatic or germ cells, representing 
a gene diversity (microbiome) 100-150 times higher than the human genome. These
germs are located mainly in the gut, where they represent a mass of about one
kilogram. The primary colonization of the gastrointestinal tract depends on the
delivery route, the bacterial flora rewarding then depending on the environment, 
food hygiene, medical treatments. The intestinal microbiota plays an important
role in the maturation of the immune system and in different physiological
functions: digestion of polysaccharides, glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins,
vitamins biosynthesis, bile salt metabolism of some amino acids and xenobiotics. 
Quantitative and qualitative changes in the microbiota are observed in a wide
range of diseases: obesity, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, inflammatory bowel
disease, autoimmune diseases, allergies... pharmacobiotics aim to modify the
intestinal microbiota in a therapeutic goal and this by various means:
prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics or fecal transplants. Intestinal flora also
plays a direct role in the metabolism of certain drugs and the microbiota should 
be considered as a predictive parameter of response to some chemotherapies.

Several bacterial species have been implicated in the development of colorectal
carcinoma (CRC), but CRC-associated changes of fecal microbiota and their
potential for cancer screening remain to be explored. Here, we used metagenomic
sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC 
patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants.
Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult
blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved > 
45% relative to the FOBT, while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of
metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early- and
late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control
populations (N = 335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the
fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at 
the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal
tumor-related host-microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift
from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino
acids in CRC patients, accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide
metabolism.

Few studies have examined associations between plasma choline metabolites and
risk of colorectal cancer. Therefore, we investigated associations between plasma
biomarkers of choline metabolism [choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, and
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] and colorectal cancer risk among postmenopausal
women in a case-control study nested within the Women's Health Initiative
Observational Study. We selected 835 matched case-control pairs, and cases were
further stratified by tumor site (proximal, distal, or rectal) and stage
(local/regional or metastatic). Colorectal cancer was assessed by self-report and
confirmed by medical records over the mean of 5.2 years of follow-up. Baseline
plasma choline metabolites were measured by LC/MS-MS. In multivariable-adjusted
conditional logistic regression models, plasma choline tended to be positively
associated with rectal cancer risk [OR (95% confidence interval, CI)(highest vs. 
lowest quartile) = 2.44 (0.93-6.40); P trend = 0.08], whereas plasma betaine was 
inversely associated with colorectal cancer overall [0.68 (0.47-0.99); P trend = 
0.01] and with local/regional tumors [0.64 (0.42-0.99); P trend = 0.009].
Notably, the plasma betaine:choline ratio was inversely associated with
colorectal cancer overall [0.56 (0.39-0.82); P trend = 0.004] as well as with
proximal [0.66 (0.41-1.06); P trend = 0.049], rectal [0.27 (0.10-0.78); P trend =
0.02], and local/regional [0.50 (0.33-0.76); P trend = 0.001] tumors. Finally,
plasma TMAO, an oxidative derivative of choline produced by intestinal bacteria, 
was positively associated with rectal cancer [3.38 (1.25-9.16); P trend = 0.02]
and with overall colorectal cancer risk among women with lower (vs. higher)
plasma vitamin B12 levels (P interaction = 0.003). Collectively, these data
suggest that alterations in choline metabolism, which may arise early in disease 
development, may be associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer. The
positive association between plasma TMAO and colorectal cancer risk is consistent
with an involvement of the gut microbiome in colorectal cancer pathogenesis.

Folate is absorbed across the human colon: evidence by using enteric-coated
caplets containing 13C-labeled [6S]-5-formyltetrahydrofolate.

DLO); CDC, Atlanta, GA (ZF and CMP); and the Food Science and Human Nutrition
Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL (JFG).

BACKGROUND: Folate intakes that do not meet or greatly exceed requirements may be
associated with negative health outcomes. A better understanding of contributors 
that influence the input side will help establish dietary guidance that ensures
health benefits without associated risks. Colonic microbiota produce large
quantities of folate, and [(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate infused during
colonoscopy is absorbed. However, it is unclear if significant quantities of
folate are absorbed in an intact microbiome.
OBJECTIVE: We determined whether and how much of a physiologic dose of
[(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate delivered in a pH-sensitive enteric caplet to an
intact colonic microbiome is absorbed.
DESIGN: Healthy adults ingested a specially designed pH-sensitive acrylic
copolymer-coated barium sulfate caplet that contained 855 nmol (400 μg)
[(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate. After a washout period ≥ 4 wk, subjects
received an intravenous injection of the same compound (214 nmol). Serially
collected blood samples before and after each test dose were analyzed by using a 
microbiological assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Caplet disintegration in the colon was observed by fluoroscopic imaging 
for 6 subjects with a mean (± SD) complete disintegration time of 284 ± 155 min. 
The mean (± SEM) rate of appearance of [(13)C5]5-methyltetrahydrofolate in plasma
was 0.33 ± 0.09 (caplet) and 5.8 ± 1.2 (intravenous) nmol/h. Likely because of
the significant time in the colon, the mean apparent absorption across the colon 
was 46%.
CONCLUSIONS: Folate is absorbed across the colon in humans with an undisturbed
microbiome. This finding and previous observations of the size of the colonic
depot of folate and its potential for manipulation by diet (eg, dietary fiber,
oligosaccharides, and probiotics) suggest that an individual's dietary folate
requirement may differ depending on the consumption of dietary constituents that 
affect the size and composition of their gastrointestinal microbiota. In
addition, a systematic investigation of the role of colonic folate on
gastrointestinal development and the prevention of colorectal cancer is
warranted. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00941174.

BACKGROUND: Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) produces the Bacteroides 
fragilis toxin, which has been associated with acute diarrheal disease,
inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer (CRC). ETBF induces colon
carcinogenesis in experimental models. Previous human studies have demonstrated
frequent asymptomatic fecal colonization with ETBF, but no study has investigated
mucosal colonization that is expected to impact colon carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We compared the presence of the bft gene in mucosal samples from
colorectal neoplasia patients (cases, n = 49) to a control group undergoing
outpatient colonoscopy for CRC screening or diagnostic workup (controls, n = 49).
Single bacterial colonies isolated anaerobically from mucosal colon tissue were
tested for the bft gene with touch-down polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: The mucosa of cases was significantly more often bft-positive on left
(85.7%) and right (91.7%) tumor and/or paired normal tissues compared with left
and right control biopsies (53.1%; P = .033 and 55.5%; P = .04, respectively).
Detection of bft was concordant in most paired mucosal samples from individual
cases or controls (75% cases; 67% controls). There was a trend toward increased
bft positivity in mucosa from late- vs early-stage CRC patients (100% vs 72.7%,
respectively; P = .093). In contrast to ETBF diarrheal disease where bft-1
detection dominates, bft-2 was the most frequent toxin isotype identified in both
cases and controls, whereas multiple bft isotypes were detected more frequently
in cases (P ≤ .02).
CONCLUSIONS: The bft gene is associated with colorectal neoplasia, especially in 
late-stage CRC. Our results suggest that mucosal bft exposure is common and may
be a risk factor for developing CRC.

BACKGROUND: Tongue diagnosis, as a unique method of traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM), discriminates physiological functions and pathological conditions by
observing the changes of the tongue coating.
AIMS: To evaluate the differences of tongue images and tongue coating microbiome 
between patients with colorectal cancer and healthy people.
METHODS: The tongue diagnostic information acquisition system was used to
photograph the tongue images and analyze the thickness of the tongue coatings in 
patients with colorectal cancer and healthy people. The next-generation
sequencing technology was used to determine the V2-V4 hypervariable region of 16S
rDNA to investigate the microbial community structure and diversity on the tongue
coating.
RESULTS: The tongue coatings in patients with colorectal cancer were obvious
thickening compared with tongue images in healthy people. The microbial community
structure on the tongue coating was different between patients with colorectal
cancer and healthy people.
CONCLUSION: Tongue diagnosis may provide important leads towards novel
microbiome-related diagnostic tools and tongue coating microbiome may be a novel 
biomarker for characterizing patient with colorectal cancer.

Whether dietary fiber protects against colorectal cancer is controversial because
of conflicting results from human epidemiologic studies. However, these studies
and mouse models of colorectal cancer have not controlled the composition of gut 
microbiota, which ferment fiber into short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate.
Butyrate is noteworthy because it has energetic and epigenetic functions in
colonocytes and tumor-suppressive properties in colorectal cancer cell lines. We 
used gnotobiotic mouse models colonized with wild-type or mutant strains of a
butyrate-producing bacterium to demonstrate that fiber does have a potent
tumor-suppressive effect but in a microbiota- and butyrate-dependent manner.
Furthermore, due to the Warburg effect, butyrate was metabolized less in tumors
where it accumulated and functioned as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor to 
stimulate histone acetylation and affect apoptosis and cell proliferation. To
support the relevance of this mechanism in human cancer, we demonstrate that
butyrate and histone-acetylation levels are elevated in colorectal
adenocarcinomas compared with normal colonic tissues.SIGNIFICANCE: These results,
which link diet and microbiota to a tumor-suppressive metabolite, provide insight
into conflicting epidemiologic findings and suggest that probiotic/prebiotic
strategies can modulate an endogenous HDAC inhibitor for anticancer
chemoprevention without the adverse effects associated with synthetic HDAC
inhibitors used in chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing appreciation for sexually dimorphic effects, but 
the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are only partially understood. 
In the present study, we explored transcriptomics and epigenetic differences in
the small intestine and colon of prepubescent male and female mice. In addition, 
the microbiota composition of the colonic luminal content has been examined.
METHODS: At postnatal day 14, male and female C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed and
the small intestine, colon and content of luminal colon were isolated. Gene
expression of both segments of the intestine was analysed by microarray analysis.
DNA methylation of the promoter regions of selected sexually dimorphic genes was 
examined by pyrosequencing. Composition of the microbiota was explored by deep
sequencing.
RESULTS: Sexually dimorphic genes were observed in both segments of the intestine
of 2-week-old mouse pups, with a stronger effect in the small intestine. Amongst 
the total of 349 genes displaying a sexually dimorphic effect in the small
intestine and/or colon, several candidates exhibited a previously established
function in the intestine (i.e. Nts, Nucb2, Alox5ap and Retnlγ). In addition,
differential expression of genes linked to intestinal bowel disease (i.e. Ccr3,
Ccl11 and Tnfr) and colorectal cancer development (i.e. Wt1 and Mmp25) was
observed between males and females. Amongst the genes displaying significant
sexually dimorphic expression, nine genes were histone-modifying enzymes,
suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms might be a potential underlying regulatory 
mechanism. However, our results reveal no significant changes in DNA methylation 
of analysed CpGs within the selected differentially expressed genes. With respect
to the bacterial community composition in the colon, a dominant effect of litter 
origin was found but no significant sex effect was detected. However, a sex
effect on the dominance of specific taxa was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals molecular dissimilarities between males and
females in the small intestine and colon of prepubescent mice, which might
underlie differences in physiological functioning and in disease predisposition
in the two sexes.

The emergence of a link between Helicobacter pylori infection and an increased
risk of gastric cancer has raised an awareness of a possible link between colonic
microbiota and colorectal cancer. Pertubation of the colonic epithelium by
toxin-producing strains of Bacteroides fragilis may increase the risk of
premalignant transdifferentiation. However, like H. pylori, B. fragilis exhibit
an ability to modulate the normal host response to infection. We speculate this
may be an underappreciated risk factor in the genesis of colon carcinogenesis in 
individuals colonised with toxin-producing strains of B. fragilis.

Enterobacteria, especially Escherichia coli, are abundant in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear
whether cancer is promoted by inflammation-induced expansion of E. coli and/or
changes in expression of specific microbial genes. Here we use longitudinal (2,
12 and 20 weeks) 16S rRNA sequencing of luminal microbiota from ex-germ-free mice
to show that inflamed Il10(-/-) mice maintain a higher abundance of
Enterobacteriaceae than healthy wild-type mice. Experiments with mono-colonized
Il10(-/-) mice reveal that host inflammation is necessary for E. coli
cancer-promoting activity. RNA-sequence analysis indicates significant changes in
E. coli gene catalogue in Il10(-/-) mice, with changes mostly driven by
adaptation to the intestinal environment. Expression of specific genes present in
the tumour-promoting E. coli pks island are modulated by inflammation/CRC
development. Thus, progression of inflammation in Il10(-/-) mice supports
Enterobacteriaceae and alters a small subset of microbial genes important for
tumour development.

Arabinoxylans (AX) consumption has been related to the treatment and prevention
of cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, colorectal cancer and obesity. The 
beneficial health effects are conferred through gut microbiota modulation, and
therefore, they have been proposed as potential slowly fermentable prebiotic
candidates. As the mechanisms are not yet well understood, the prebiotic
potential of AX from brewer's spent grain (BSG) has been investigated. Two types 
of AX from BSG (AX1 and AX2) of different length and branching averages were
fermented with human faecal inocula and compared to fermented cultures containing
a commercial prebiotic (fructooligosaccharide (FOS)) and cultures with no added
carbohydrate (control). Results demonstrated that the AX were extensively
metabolised after 48 h of fermentation. The pH decreased along fermentation and
the lowest value was achieved in AX1 cultures. The production of short chain
fatty acids (SCFA) was higher in AX cultures than in cultures containing FOS and 
controls, with AX1 presenting the highest concentrations. The stimulatory effect 
of beneficial bacteria was higher in AX cultures, and AX2 presented the highest
positive effect. Prebiotic potential of AX from BSG was confirmed by the
production of SCFA and the modulation of gut microbiota, especially by the high
increase in bifidobacteria populations.

Recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiome may be an important factor 
in the development of colorectal cancer. Abnormalities in the gut microbiome have
been reported in patients with colorectal cancer; however, this microbial
community has not been explored as a potential screen for early-stage disease. We
characterized the gut microbiome in patients from three clinical groups
representing the stages of colorectal cancer development: healthy, adenoma, and
carcinoma. Analysis of the gut microbiome from stool samples revealed both an
enrichment and depletion of several bacterial populations associated with
adenomas and carcinomas. Combined with known clinical risk factors of colorectal 
cancer (e.g., BMI, age, race), data from the gut microbiome significantly
improved the ability to differentiate between healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma
clinical groups relative to risk factors alone. Using Bayesian methods, we
determined that using gut microbiome data as a screening tool improved the
pretest to posttest probability of adenoma more than 50-fold. For example, the
pretest probability in a 65-year-old was 0.17% and, after using the microbiome
data, this increased to 10.67% (1 in 9 chance of having an adenoma). Taken
together, the results of our study demonstrate the feasibility of using the
composition of the gut microbiome to detect the presence of precancerous and
cancerous lesions. Furthermore, these results support the need for more
cross-sectional studies with diverse populations and linkage to other stool
markers, dietary data, and personal health information.

High red meat consumption is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer.
Various mechanisms have been proposed, including mutagenesis, alterations of the 
gut microbiome, and effects on local immunity and inflammation. This lack of
well-defined mechanistic explanations for diet and cancer associations coupled
with our inability to derive causal inferences from population-based studies
allows us to rationalize that burger we ate at lunch or that steak we ate at
dinner. The preparation and consumption of red meat is a major social and dining 
pleasure in the Western culture, so there is resistance to concern ourselves with
the cancer risk associated with red meat. In fact, advertisements do not add a
rapid-fire statement that consumption of more than half a portion of red meat per
day has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
cancer, and even death, because these data are not from randomized controlled
trials? Would we heed a warning if there was evidence that burgers and steaks
induced the expression of small noncoding RNAs that inhibit the expression of
tumor-suppressor genes in our enterocytes? What level of evidence is necessary to
convince ourselves that a dietary exposure is sufficiently causal to put a
warning label on it? How do we experimentally obtain such evidence? If we knew
the mechanism, perhaps we could modify the risk sufficiently such that we can
have our steak and eat it too-without the warnings.

The etiology of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been linked to deficiencies in
mismatch repair and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) proteins, diet, inflammatory
processes, and gut microbiota. However, the mechanism through which the
microbiota synergizes with these etiologic factors to promote CRC is not clear.
We report that altering the microbiota composition reduces CRC in
APC(Min/+)MSH2(-/-) mice, and that a diet reduced in carbohydrates phenocopies
this effect. Gut microbes did not induce CRC in these mice through an
inflammatory response or the production of DNA mutagens but rather by providing
carbohydrate-derived metabolites such as butyrate that fuel hyperproliferation of
MSH2(-/-) colon epithelial cells. Further, we provide evidence that the mismatch 
repair pathway has a role in regulating β-catenin activity and modulating the
differentiation of transit-amplifying cells in the colon. These data thereby
provide an explanation for the interaction between microbiota, diet, and mismatch
repair deficiency in CRC induction. PAPERCLIP:

BACKGROUND: The clinical benefit of guaiac fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) is now
well established for colorectal cancer screening. Growing evidence has
demonstrated that epigenetic modifications and fecal microbiota changes, also
known as dysbiosis, are associated with CRC pathogenesis and might be used as
surrogate markers of CRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study that included all
consecutive subjects that were referred (from 2003 to 2007) for screening
colonoscopies. Prior to colonoscopy, effluents (fresh stools, sera-S and urine-U)
were harvested and FOBTs performed. Methylation levels were measured in stools, S
and U for 3 genes (Wif1, ALX-4, and Vimentin) selected from a panel of 63 genes; 
Kras mutations and seven dominant and subdominant bacterial populations in stools
were quantified. Calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square,
and discrimination was determined by calculating the C-statistic (Area Under
Curve) and Net Reclassification Improvement index.
RESULTS: There were 247 individuals (mean age 60.8±12.4 years, 52% of males) in
the study group, and 90 (36%) of these individuals were patients with advanced
polyps or invasive adenocarcinomas. A multivariate model adjusted for age and
FOBT led to a C-statistic of 0.83 [0.77-0.88]. After supplementary sequential
(one-by-one) adjustment, Wif-1 methylation (S or U) and fecal microbiota
dysbiosis led to increases of the C-statistic to 0.90 [0.84-0.94] (p = 0.02) and 
0.81 [0.74-0.86] (p = 0.49), respectively. When adjusted jointly for FOBT and
Wif-1 methylation or fecal microbiota dysbiosis, the increase of the C-statistic 
was even more significant (0.91 and 0.85, p<0.001 and p = 0.10, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The detection of methylated Wif-1 in either S or U has a higher
performance accuracy compared to guaiac FOBT for advanced colorectal neoplasia
screening. Conversely, fecal microbiota dysbiosis detection was not more
accurate. Blood and urine testing could be used in those individuals reluctant to
undergo stool testing.

Dysfunction of Paneth and goblet cells in the intestine contributes to
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). 
Here, we report a role for the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 in the
control of anti-bacterial defense. Mice with an intestinal specific Sirt1
deficiency (Sirt1int-/-) have more Paneth and goblet cells with a consequent
rearrangement of the gut microbiota. From a mechanistic point of view, the
effects on mouse intestinal cell maturation are mediated by SIRT1-dependent
changes in the acetylation status of SPDEF, a master regulator of Paneth and
goblet cells. Our results suggest that targeting SIRT1 may be of interest in the 
management of IBD and CAC.

BACKGROUND: Both genetic and epigenetic alterations have been reported to act as 
driving forces of tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC), but a growing body of
evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota may be an aetiological factor in the
initiation and progression of CRC. Recently, the "driver-passenger" model for CRC
has connected these different factors, but little has been done to characterize
the CRC gut microbiome.
FINDINGS: Building on the driver-passenger model, we used 454 pyrosequencing of
bacterial 16S rRNA genes associated with 10 normal, 10 adenoma, and 8 tumor
biopsy samples, and found 7 potential driver bacterial genera and 12 potential
passenger bacterial genera (7 being pro-inflammatory and 5 anti-inflammatory).
Further analysis also showed certain co-expression patterns among different
clusters of bacteria that may potentially be related to the promotion or
progression of gut cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide preliminary experimental evidence
supporting the proposition of bacterial "driver-passenger model" for CRC, and
identified potentially novel microbial agents that may be connected to risk of
CRC in a Han Chinese population.

Ellagic acid metabolism by human gut microbiota: consistent observation of three 
urolithin phenotypes in intervention trials, independent of food source, age, and
health status.

P.O. Box 164, 30100 Espinardo, Murcia, Spain.

Three phenotypes for urolithin production after ellagitannin and ellagic acid
intake are consistently observed in different human intervention trials. Subjects
can be stratified into three urolithin-producing groups. "Phenotype A" produced
only urolithin A conjugates, which included between 25 and 80% of the volunteers 
in the different trials. "Phenotype B" produced isourolithin A and/or urolithin B
in addition to urolithin A, this being the second relevant group (10-50%).
"Phenotype 0" (5-25%) was that in which these urolithins were not detected. The
three phenotypes were observed independently of the volunteers' health status and
demographic characteristics (age, gender, body mass index (BMI)) and of the
amount or type of ellagitannin food source ingested (walnuts and other nuts,
strawberries, raspberries, and other berries or pomegranates). Interestingly, a
higher percentage of phenotype B was observed in those volunteers with chronic
illness (metabolic syndrome or colorectal cancer) associated with gut microbial
imbalance (dysbiosis). These urolithin phenotypes could show differences in the
human gut microbiota and should be considered in intervention trials dealing with
health benefits of ellagitannins or ellagic acid. Whether this phenotypic
variation could be a biomarker related to differential health benefits or illness
predisposition deserves further research.

Structure of the gut microbiome following colonization with human feces
determines colonic tumor burden.

BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence indicates that the gut microbiome plays a 
role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients with CRC harbor gut 
microbiomes that are structurally distinct from those of healthy individuals;
however, without the ability to track individuals during disease progression, it 
has not been possible to observe changes in the microbiome over the course of
tumorigenesis. Mouse models have demonstrated that these changes can further
promote colonic tumorigenesis. However, these models have relied upon
mouse-adapted bacterial populations and so it remains unclear which human-adapted
bacterial populations are responsible for modulating tumorigenesis.
RESULTS: We transplanted fecal microbiota from three CRC patients and three
healthy individuals into germ-free mice, resulting in six structurally distinct
microbial communities. Subjecting these mice to a chemically induced model of CRC
resulted in different levels of tumorigenesis between mice. Differences in the
number of tumors were strongly associated with the baseline microbiome structure 
in mice, but not with the cancer status of the human donors. Partitioning of
baseline communities into enterotypes by Dirichlet multinomial mixture modeling
resulted in three enterotypes that corresponded with tumor burden. The taxa most 
strongly positively correlated with increased tumor burden were members of the
Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Alistipes, and Akkermansia, all of which are
Gram-negative. Members of the Gram-positive Clostridiales, including multiple
members of Clostridium Group XIVa, were strongly negatively correlated with
tumors. Analysis of the inferred metagenome of each community revealed a negative
correlation between tumor count and the potential for butyrate production, and a 
positive correlation between tumor count and the capacity for host glycan
degradation. Despite harboring distinct gut communities, all mice underwent
conserved structural changes over the course of the model. The extent of these
changes was also correlated with tumor incidence.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the initial structure of the microbiome
determines susceptibility to colonic tumorigenesis. There appear to be opposing
roles for certain Gram-negative (Bacteroidales and Verrucomicrobia) and
Gram-positive (Clostridiales) bacteria in tumor susceptibility. Thus, the impact 
of community structure is potentially mediated by the balance between protective,
butyrate-producing populations and inflammatory, mucin-degrading populations.

OBJECTIVE: Commensal bacteria and innate immunity play a major role in the
development of colorectal cancer (CRC). We propose that selected commensals
polarise colon macrophages to produce endogenous mutagens that initiate
chromosomal instability (CIN), lead to expression of progenitor and tumour stem
cell markers, and drive CRC through a bystander effect.
DESIGN: Primary murine colon epithelial cells were repetitively exposed to
Enterococcus faecalis-infected macrophages, or purified trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
(4-HNE)-an endogenous mutagen and spindle poison produced by macrophages. CIN,
gene expression, growth as allografts in immunodeficient mice were examined for
clones and expression of markers confirmed using interleukin (IL) 10 knockout
mice colonised by E. faecalis.
RESULTS: Primary colon epithelial cells exposed to polarised macrophages or
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal developed CIN and were transformed after 10 weekly
treatments. In immunodeficient mice, 8 of 25 transformed clones grew as poorly
differentiated carcinomas with 3 tumours invading skin and/or muscle. All tumours
stained for cytokeratins confirming their epithelial cell origin. Gene expression
profiling of clones showed alterations in 3 to 7 cancer driver genes per clone.
Clones also strongly expressed stem/progenitor cell markers Ly6A and Ly6E.
Although not differentially expressed in clones, murine allografts positively
stained for the tumour stem cell marker doublecortin-like kinase 1.
Doublecortin-like kinase 1 and Ly6A/E were expressed by epithelial cells in colon
biopsies for areas of inflamed and dysplastic tissue from E. faecalis-colonised
IL-10 knockout mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These results validate a novel mechanism for CRC that involves
endogenous CIN and cellular transformation arising through a microbiome-driven
bystander effect.

BACKGROUND: There is clear evidence that nutrition and lifestyle can modify
colorectal cancer risk. However, it is not clear if those factors can affect
colorectal cancer treatment, recurrence, survival and quality of life. This paper
describes the background and design of the "COlorectal cancer: Longitudinal,
Observational study on Nutritional and lifestyle factors that may influence
colorectal tumour recurrence, survival and quality of life" - COLON - study. The 
main aim of this study is to assess associations of diet and other lifestyle
factors, with colorectal cancer recurrence, survival and quality of life. We
extensively investigate diet and lifestyle of colorectal cancer patients at
diagnosis and during the following years; this design paper focusses on the
initial exposures of interest: diet and dietary supplement use, body composition,
nutrient status (e.g. vitamin D), and composition of the gut microbiota.
METHODS/DESIGN: The COLON study is a multi-centre prospective cohort study among 
at least 1,000 incident colorectal cancer patients recruited from 11 hospitals in
the Netherlands. Patients with colorectal cancer are invited upon diagnosis. Upon
recruitment, after 6 months, 2 years and 5 years, patients fill out
food-frequency questionnaires; questionnaires about dietary supplement use,
physical activity, weight, height, and quality of life; and donate blood samples.
Diagnostic CT-scans are collected to assess cross-sectional areas of skeletal
muscle, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and intermuscular fat, and to assess
muscle attenuation. Blood samples are biobanked to facilitate future analyse of
biomarkers, nutrients, DNA etc. Analysis of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels,
and analysis of metabolomic profiles are scheduled. A subgroup of patients with
colon cancer is asked to provide faecal samples before and at several time points
after colon resection to study changes in gut microbiota during treatment. For
all patients, information on vital status is retrieved by linkage with national
registries. Information on clinical characteristics is gathered from linkage with
the Netherlands Cancer Registry and with hospital databases. Hazards ratios will 
be calculated for dietary and lifestyle factors at diagnosis in relation to
recurrence and survival. Repeated measures analyses will be performed to assess
changes over time in dietary and other factors in relation to recurrence and
survival.

Bacterial colonisation of the gut is involved in the development of
colitis-associated colorectal cancer. However, it remains unclear how the gut
microbiota dynamically shifts correlating with colorectal carcinogenesis. Here,
we reveal the longitudinal shifts in the microbial community that occur with
colitis-associated colorectal cancer. High-throughput sequencing results for the 
bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V3 region) were compared for azoxymethane/dextran sodium
sulphate-treated mice and control mice. We found that microbial community
structure was significantly altered by chronic colitis. Microbes in the species
Streptococcus luteciae, Lactobacillus hamster, Bacteroides uniformis and
Bacteroides ovatus were increased during colorectal carcinogenesis. Histological 
measurements for a molecular network including six interconnected key factors
from inflammation to cancer, namely p65, p53, COX-2, PPARγ, CCR2 and β-catenin,
indicated that the microbiome modifications were correlated with molecular
pathogenesis of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Phylotype modifications
after each AOM/DSS cycle were identified. A longitudinal microbial network was
then constructed for the gut microbiome and showed that the phylotype shifts
during this process were complex and highly dynamic. This work may provide a
deeper understanding of the role of the microbiota and microbe-host interactions 
in colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies demonstrate a link between gastrointestinal
cancers and environmental factors such as diet. It has been suggested that
environmental cancer risk is determined by the interaction between diet and
microbes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that
microbiota composition during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression might differ
depending on the stage of the disease.
METHODS: A total of 28 age-matched and sex-matched subjects, seven with CRC
adenocarcinoma, 11 with tubular adenomas and ten healthy subjects with intact
colon, were included into the study. Microbiomes from mucosal and fecal samples
were analyzed with 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing, together with
quantitative PCR of specific bacteria and archaea.
RESULTS: The principal coordinates analysis clearly separated healthy tissue
samples from polyps and tumors, supporting the presence of specific bacterial
consortia that are associated with affected sites and that can serve as potential
biomarkers of CRC progression. A higher presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and
Enterobacteriaceae was found by qPCR in samples from CRC compared to healthy
controls. We observed a correlation between CRC process development and levels of
Methanobacteriales (R = 0.537, P = 0.007) and Methanobrevibacterium (R = 0.574, P
= 0.03) in fecal samples.
CONCLUSION: Differences in microbial and archaeal composition between mucosal
samples from healthy and disease tissues were observed in tubular adenoma and
adenocarcinoma. In addition, microbiota from mucosal samples represented the
underlying dysbiosis, whereas fecal samples seem not to be appropriate to detect 
shifts in microbial composition. CRC risk is influenced by microbial composition,
showing differences according to disease progression step and tumor severity.

In humans, the intestine is the major reservoir of microbes. Although the
intestinal microbial community exists in a state of homeostasis called eubiosis, 
environmental and genetics factors can lead to microbial perturbation or
dysbiosis, a state associated with various pathologies including inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Dysbiotic microbiota is thought
to contribute to the initiation and progression of CRC. At the opposite end of
the spectrum, two recently published studies in Science reveal that the
microbiota is essential for chemotherapeutic drug efficacy, suggesting a
beneficial microbial function in cancer management. The dichotomy between the
beneficial and detrimental roles of the microbiota during cancer initiation,
progression, and treatment emphasize the interwoven relationship between bacteria
and cancer. Moreover, these findings suggest that the microbiota could be
considered as a therapeutic target, not only at the level of cancer prevention,
but also during management, i.e. by enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutics.

Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with increased risk of developing
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Epidemiological data show that the
consumption of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) decreases the risk of 
sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). Importantly, recent data have shown that
eicosapentaenoic acid-free fatty acid (EPA-FFA) reduces polyp formation and
growth in models of familial adenomatous polyposis. However, the effects of
dietary EPA-FFA are unknown in CAC. We tested the effectiveness of substituting
EPA-FFA, for other dietary fats, in preventing inflammation and cancer in the
AOM-DSS model of CAC. The AOM-DSS protocols were designed to evaluate the effect 
of EPA-FFA on both initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis. We found that
EPA-FFA diet strongly decreased tumor multiplicity, incidence and maximum tumor
size in the promotion and initiation arms. Moreover EPA-FFA, in particular in the
initiation arm, led to reduced cell proliferation and nuclear β-catenin
expression, whilst it increased apoptosis. In both arms, EPA-FFA treatment led to
increased membrane switch from ω-6 to ω-3 PUFAs and a concomitant reduction in
PGE2 production. We observed no significant changes in intestinal inflammation
between EPA-FFA treated arms and AOM-DSS controls. Importantly, we found that
EPA-FFA treatment restored the loss of Notch signaling found in the AOM-DSS
control and resulted in the enrichment of Lactobacillus species in the gut
microbiota. Taken together, our data suggest that EPA-FFA is an excellent
candidate for CRC chemoprevention in CAC.

Recent reports have suggested that multiple factors such as host genetics,
environment and diet can promote the progression of healthy mucosa towards
sporadic colorectal carcinoma. Accumulating evidence has additionally associated 
intestinal bacteria with disease initiation and progression. In order to examine 
and analyze the composition of gut microbiota in the absence of confounding
influences, we have established an animal model of 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine
(DMH)-induced colon cancer. Using this model, we have performed pyrosequencing of
the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes in this study to determine the diversity and 
breadth of the intestinal microbial species. Our findings indicate that the
microbial composition of the intestinal lumen differs significantly between
control and tumor groups. The abundance of Firmicutes was elevated whereas the
abundance of Bacteroidetes and Spirochetes was reduced in the lumen of CRC rats. 
Fusobacteria was not detected in any of the healthy rats and there was no
significant difference in observed Proteobacteria species when comparing the
bacterial communities between our two groups. Interestingly, the abundance of
Proteobacteria was higher in CRC rats. At the genus level, Bacteroides exhibited 
a relatively higher abundance in CRC rats compared to controls (14.92% vs. 9.22%,
p<0.001). Meanwhile, Prevotella (55.22% vs. 26.19%), Lactobacillus (3.71% vs.
2.32%) and Treponema (3.04% vs. 2.43%), were found to be significantly more
abundant in healthy rats than CRC rats (p<0.001, respectively). We also
demonstrate a significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria such as
Roseburia and Eubacterium in the gut microbiota of CRC rats. Furthermore, a
significant increase in Desulfovibrio, Erysipelotrichaceae and Fusobacterium was 
also observed in the tumor group. A decrease in probiotic species such as
Ruminococcus and Lactobacillus was likewise observed in the tumor group.
Collectively, we can conclude that a significant difference in intestinal
bacterial flora exists between healthy rats and CRC rats.

BACKGROUND: A colorectal tumor is not an isolated entity growing in a restricted 
location of the body. The patient's gut environment constitutes the framework
where the tumor evolves and this relationship promotes and includes a complex and
tight correlation of the tumor with inflammation, blood vessels formation,
nutrition, and gut microbiome composition. The tumor influence in the environment
could both promote an anti-tumor or a pro-tumor response.
METHODS: A set of 98 paired adjacent mucosa and tumor tissues from colorectal
cancer (CRC) patients and 50 colon mucosa from healthy donors (246 samples in
total) were included in this work. RNA extracted from each sample was hybridized 
in Affymetrix chips Human Genome U219. Functional relationships between genes
were inferred by means of systems biology using both transcriptional regulation
networks (ARACNe algorithm) and protein-protein interaction networks (BIANA
software).
RESULTS: Here we report a transcriptomic analysis revealing a number of genes
activated in adjacent mucosa from CRC patients, not activated in mucosa from
healthy donors. A functional analysis of these genes suggested that this active
reaction of the adjacent mucosa was related to the presence of the tumor.
Transcriptional and protein-interaction networks were used to further elucidate
this response of normal gut in front of the tumor, revealing a crosstalk between 
proteins secreted by the tumor and receptors activated in the adjacent colon
tissue; and vice versa. Remarkably, Slit family of proteins activated ROBO
receptors in tumor whereas tumor-secreted proteins transduced a cellular signal
finally activating AP-1 in adjacent tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: The systems-level approach provides new insights into the
micro-ecology of colorectal tumorogenesis. Disrupting this intricate molecular
network of cell-cell communication and pro-inflammatory microenvironment could be
a therapeutic target in CRC patients.

SCOPE: Urolithins are bioactive metabolites produced by the gut microbiota from
ellagitannins (ETs) and ellagic acid (EA). We investigated whether urolithins
could be detected in colon tissues from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients after
pomegranate extract (PE) intake.
METHODS AND RESULTS: CRC patients (n = 52) were divided into controls and PEs
consumers (900 mg/day for 15 days) before surgical resection. PEs with low (PE-1)
and high (PE-2) punicalagin:EA ratio were administered. Twenty-three metabolites,
but no ellagitannins, were detected in urine, plasma, normal (NT) or malignant
(MT) colon tissues using UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS (UPLC, ultra performance liquid
chromatography; QTOF, quadrupole TOF). Free EA, five EA conjugates, gallic acid
and 12 urolithin derivatives were found in colon tissues. Individual and total
metabolites levels were higher in NT than in MT, independently of the PE
consumed. The maximal mean concentration (1671 ± 367 ng/g) was found in NT after 
consumption of PE-1 and the lowest concentration (42.4 ± 10.2 ng/g) in MT with
PE-2. Urolithin A or isourolithin A were the main urolithins produced (54 and 46%
patients with urolithin A or isourolithin A phenotype, respectively). High
punicalagin content (PE-2) hampered urolithins formation.
CONCLUSION: Significant levels of EA derivatives and urolithins are found in
human colon tissues from CRC patients after consumption of pomegranate. Further
studies are warranted to elucidate their biological activity.

Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are at a higher risk of colorectal cancer 
(CRC). The objective of our study was to examine the inter-relationship among
infection sites, systemic antibiotic use and risk of CRC among patients with Type
2 diabetes mellitus. From a diabetic cohort from the Taiwan's National Health
Insurance claims database, we identified 3,593 incident colon cancer cases, 1,979
rectal cancer cases and 22,288 controls and conducted a nested case-control study
to examine the association between antibiotic use and CRC incidence. Logistic
regression models were applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and the 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) between infection sites, antibiotic use and CRC
incidence. Patients with intra-abdominal infection were significantly associated 
with increased risk for colon cancer (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.73-2.35) and rectal
cancer (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.26-2.00). Any antianaerobic antibiotic use was
associated with a higher risk of colon cancer (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 2.12-2.52) and
rectal cancer (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.50-1.90) but without an obvious
dose-response relationship for cumulative use. Antianaerobic antibiotics also
increased the risks for those with nonintra-abdominal infection. No association
was found between antiaerobic agent use and the CRC risk. The results suggest
intra-abdominal infections and antianaerobic antibiotic use may be a marker for
precancerous lesions or early CRC, although the possibility of antianaerobic
antibiotics playing an additional role cannot be excluded. Further research
examining the relationship between intra-abdominal infection, antianaerobic
antibiotics use and possible change of microbiota leading to colorectal
carcinogenesis is warranted.

CPT-11 is a drug used as chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. CPT-11 causes toxic 
side-effects in patients. CPT-11 toxicity has been attributed to the activity of 
intestinal microbiota, however, intestinal microbiota may also have protective
effects in CP!-11 chemotherapy. This study aimed to elucidate mechanisms through 
which microbiota and dietary fibres could modify host health. Rats bearing a Ward
colon carcinoma were treated with a two-cycle CPT-11/5-fluorouracil therapy
recapitulating clinical therapy of colorectal cancer. Animals were fed with a
semi-purified diet or a semi-purified diet was supplemented with non-digestible
carbohydrates (isomalto-oligosaccharides, resistant starch,
fructo-oligosaccharides, or inulin) in 3 independent experiments. Changes in
intestinal microbiota, bacteria translocating to mesenteric lymphnodes, cecal GUD
activity, and cecal SCFA production, and the intestinal concentration of CPT-11
and its metabolites were analysed. Non-digestible carbohydrates significantly
influenced feed intake, body weight and other indicators of animal health. The
identification of translocating bacteria and their quantification in cecal
microbiota indicated that overgrowth of the intestine by opportunistic pathogens 
was not a major contributor to CPT-11 toxicity. Remarkably, fecal GUD activity
positively correlated to body weight and feed intake but negatively correlated to
cecal SN-38 concentrations and IL1-β. The reduction in CPT-11 toxicity by
non-digestible carbohydrates did not correlate to stimulation of specific
bacterial taxa. However, cecal butyrate concentrations and feed intake were
highly correlated. The protective role of intestinal butyrate production was
substantiated by a positive correlation of the host expression of MCT1
(monocarboxylate transporter 1) with body weight as well as a positive
correlation of the abundance of bacterial butyryl-CoA gene with cecal butyrate
concentrations. These correlations support the interpretation that the influence 
of dietary fibre on CPT-11 toxicity is partially mediated by an increased cecal
production of butyrate.

BACKGROUND: Numerous cancers have been linked to microorganisms. Given that
colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths and the colon is
continuously exposed to a high diversity of microbes, the relationship between
gut mucosal microbiome and colorectal cancer needs to be explored. Metagenomic
studies have shown an association between Fusobacterium species and colorectal
carcinoma. Here, we have extended these studies with deeper sequencing of a much 
larger number (n = 130) of colorectal carcinoma and matched normal control
tissues. We analyzed these data using co-occurrence networks in order to identify
microbe-microbe and host-microbe associations specific to tumors.
RESULTS: We confirmed tumor over-representation of Fusobacterium species and
observed significant co-occurrence within individual tumors of Fusobacterium,
Leptotrichia and Campylobacter species. This polymicrobial signature was
associated with over-expression of numerous host genes, including the gene
encoding the pro-inflammatory chemokine Interleukin-8. The tumor-associated
bacteria we have identified are all Gram-negative anaerobes, recognized
previously as constituents of the oral microbiome, which are capable of causing
infection. We isolated a novel strain of Campylobacter showae from a colorectal
tumor specimen. This strain is substantially diverged from a previously sequenced
oral Campylobacter showae isolate, carries potential virulence genes, and
aggregates with a previously isolated tumor strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
CONCLUSIONS: A polymicrobial signature of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria is
associated with colorectal carcinoma tissue.

Intestinal homeostasis depends on the proper activity of the intestinal stem
cells (ISCs) and an appropriate host response to the normal resident microbiota. 
The question on the effect of microbiota on ISCs behavior has not been addressed 
yet. Canonical Wnt pathway and ISC gene expression signature was compared in
germfree vs. conventional and MyD88(-/-) vs. Myd88(+/+) mice based on publicly
available gene expression data sets. Microbiota and MyD88-dependent signaling
have distinct effects on the Wnt pathway and ISC at gene expression level. In
addition, the effect of microbiota and MyD88-dependent signaling on Wnt pathway
and ISCs show regional variation. The net effect of microbiota on Wnt pathway and
ISCs cannot be inferred from the available data. Nonetheless, the data are
suggestive of a potential regulatory mechanism of the Wnt pathway by the
microbiota and plausibly by any alteration in the microbiota composition.

Although the microbiota has been shown to drive production of interleukin-17A
(IL-17A) from T helper 17 cells to promote cell proliferation and tumor growth in
colorectal cancer, the molecular mechanisms for microbiota-mediated regulation of
tumorigenesis are largely unknown. Here, we found that the innate-like cytokine
IL-17C was upregulated in human colorectal cancers and in mouse intestinal tumor 
models. Alterations in the microbiota drove IL-17C upregulation specifically in
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) through Toll-like receptor
(TLR)-MyD88-dependent signaling during intestinal tumorigenesis.
Microbiota-driven IL-17C induced Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression in IECs in an
autocrine manner to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis in both chemically
induced and spontaneous intestinal tumor models. Thus, IL-17C promotes cancer
development by increasing IEC survival, and the microbiota can mediate cancer
pathogenesis through regulation of IL-17C.

Fusobacterium species are part of the gut microbiome in humans. Recent studies
have identified overrepresentation of Fusobacterium in colorectal cancer tissues,
but it is not yet clear whether this is pathogenic or simply an epiphenomenon. In
this study, we evaluated the relationship between Fusobacterium status and
molecular features in colorectal cancers through quantitative real-time PCR in
149 colorectal cancer tissues, 89 adjacent normal appearing mucosae and 72
colonic mucosae from cancer-free individuals. Results were correlated with CpG
island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status, microsatellite instability (MSI), and 
mutations in BRAF, KRAS, TP53, CHD7, and CHD8. Whole-exome capture sequencing
data were also available in 11 cases. Fusobacterium was detectable in 111 of 149 
(74%) colorectal cancer tissues and heavily enriched in 9% (14/149) of the cases.
As expected, Fusobacterium was also detected in normal appearing mucosae from
both cancer and cancer-free individuals, but the amount of bacteria was much
lower compared with colorectal cancer tissues (a mean of 250-fold lower for
Pan-fusobacterium). We found the Fusobacterium-high colorectal cancer group
(FB-high) to be associated with CIMP positivity (P = 0.001), TP53 wild-type (P = 
0.015), hMLH1 methylation positivity (P = 0.0028), MSI (P = 0.018), and CHD7/8
mutation positivity (P = 0.002). Among the 11 cases where whole-exome sequencing 
data were available, two that were FB-high cases also had the highest number of
somatic mutations (a mean of 736 per case in FB-high vs. 225 per case in all
others). Taken together, our findings show that Fusobacterium enrichment is
associated with specific molecular subsets of colorectal cancers, offering
support for a pathogenic role in colorectal cancer for this gut microbiome
component.

BACKGROUND: Colonic polyps are common tumors occurring in ~50% of Western
populations with ~10% risk of malignant progression. Dietary agents have been
considered the primary environmental exposure to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) 
development. However, the colonic mucosa is permanently in contact with the
microbiota and its metabolic products including toxins that also have the
potential to trigger oncogenic transformation.
AIM: To analyze fecal DNA for microbiota composition and functional potential in 
African Americans with pre-neoplastic lesions.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We analyzed the bacterial composition of stool samples from 
6 healthy individuals and 6 patients with colon polyps using 16S ribosomal
RNA-based phylogenetic microarray; the Human intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) and 
16S rRNA gene barcoded 454 pyrosequencing. The functional potential was
determined by sequence-based metagenomics using 454 pyrosequencing.
RESULTS: Fecal microbiota profiling of samples from the healthy and polyp
patients using both a phylogenetic microarraying (HITChip) and barcoded 454
pyrosequencing generated similar results. A distinction between both sets of
samples was only obtained when the analysis was performed at the sub-genus level.
Most of the species leading to the dissociation were from the Bacteroides group. 
The metagenomic analysis did not reveal major differences in bacterial gene
prevalence/abundances between the two groups even when the analysis and
comparisons were restricted to available Bacteroides genomes.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that at the pre-neoplastic stages, there is a
trend showing microbiota changes between healthy and colon polyp patients at the 
sub-genus level. These differences were not reflected at the genome/functions
levels. Bacteria and associated functions within the Bacteroides group need to be
further analyzed and dissected to pinpoint potential actors in the early colon
oncogenic transformation in a large sample size.

PURPOSE: The intestinal microbiota is potentially involved in the development of 
colorectal carcinoma via various mechanisms. Escherichia coli are commensal
bacteria of the human gut microbiota, but some pathogenic strains have acquired
the ability to induce chronic inflammation and/or produce toxins, such as
cyclomodulin, which could participate in the carcinogenesis process. Here, we
analyzed the E. coli population associated with mucosa of patients with colon
cancer in relation to clinicopathologic characteristics. We assessed carcinogenic
properties of a colon cancer-associated E. coli strain in multiple intestinal
neoplasia (Min) mice.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mucosa-associated or internalized E. coli were quantified
and characterized from tumors and mucosa of patients with colon cancer and the
healthy mucosa of diverticulosis controls. Min mice were inoculated with a colon 
cancer-associated E. coli strain (11G5). The number of colonic polyps was
evaluated at 7 weeks after infection.
RESULTS: An increased level of mucosa-associated and internalized E. coli was
observed in the tumors compared with normal tissue. A relationship between poor
prognostic factors for colon cancer (tumor-node-metastasis stage) and
colonization of mucosa by E. coli was observed. Pathogenic cyclomodulin-positive 
E. coli strains were more prevalent on mucosa of patients with stages III/IV than
those with stage I colon cancer. Proliferative index and E. coli colonization
level of the mucosa distant from the tumor significantly correlated. Min mice
infected with the E. coli strain 11G5 displayed a marked increase in the number
of visible colonic polyps compared with controls.
CONCLUSION: These findings support that pathogenic E. coli could be a cofactor in
pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.

We tested the hypothesis that an altered community of gut microbes is associated 
with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a study of 47 CRC case subjects and 94
control subjects. 16S rRNA genes in fecal bacterial DNA were amplified by
universal primers, sequenced by 454 FLX technology, and aligned for taxonomic
classification to microbial genomes using the QIIME pipeline. Taxonomic
differences were confirmed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
adjusted for false discovery rate. All statistical tests were two-sided. From
794217 16S rRNA gene sequences, we found that CRC case subjects had decreased
overall microbial community diversity (P = .02). In taxonomy-based analyses,
lower relative abundance of Clostridia (68.6% vs 77.8%) and increased carriage of
Fusobacterium (multivariable odds ratio [OR] = 4.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]
= 1.62 to 10.47) and Porphyromonas (OR = 5.17; 95% CI = 1.75 to 15.25) were found
in case subjects compared with control subjects. Because of the potentially
modifiable nature of the gut bacteria, our findings may have implications for CRC
prevention.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide with colorectal cancer (CRC) ranking
as the third contributing to overall cancer mortality. Non-digestible compounds
such as dietary fiber have been inversely associated with CRC in epidemiological 
in vivo and in vitro studies. In order to investigate the effect of fermentation 
products from a whole non-digestible fraction of common bean versus the
short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) on colon cancer cells, we evaluated the human gut 
microbiota fermented non-digestible fraction (hgm-FNDF) of cooked common bean
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivar Negro 8025 and a synthetic mixture SCFAs,
mimicking their concentration in the lethal concentration 50 (SCFA-LC50) of FNDF 
(hgm-FNDF-LC50), on the molecular changes in human colon adenocarcinoma cells
(HT-29). Total mRNA from hgm-FNDF-LC50 and SCFA-LC50 treated HT-29 cells were
used to perform qPCR arrays to determine the effect of the treatments on the
transcriptional expression of 84 genes related to the p53-pathway. This study
showed that both treatments inhibited cell proliferation in accordance with
modulating RB1, CDC2, CDC25A, NFKB and E2F genes. Furthermore, we found an
association between the induction of apoptosis and the modulation of APAF1, BID, 
CASP9, FASLG, TNFR10B and BCL2A genes. The results suggest a mechanism of action 
by which the fermentation of non-digestible compounds of common bean exert a
beneficial effect better than the SCFA mixture by modulating the expression of
antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic genes in HT-29 cells to a greater extent,
supporting previous results on cell behavior, probably due to the participation
of other compounds, such as phenolic fatty acids derivatives and biopetides.

Recent studies have shown that individuals with colorectal cancer have an altered
gut microbiome compared to healthy controls. It remains unclear whether these
differences are a response to tumorigenesis or actively drive tumorigenesis. To
determine the role of the gut microbiome in the development of colorectal cancer,
we characterized the gut microbiome in a murine model of inflammation-associated 
colorectal cancer that mirrors what is seen in humans. We followed the
development of an abnormal microbial community structure associated with
inflammation and tumorigenesis in the colon. Tumor-bearing mice showed enrichment
in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with members of the Bacteroides,
Odoribacter, and Akkermansia genera and decreases in OTUs affiliated with members
of the Prevotellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families. Conventionalization of
germfree mice with microbiota from tumor-bearing mice significantly increased
tumorigenesis in the colon compared to that for animals colonized with a healthy 
gut microbiome from untreated mice. Furthermore, at the end of the model,
germfree mice colonized with microbiota from tumor-bearing mice harbored a higher
relative abundance of populations associated with tumor formation in conventional
animals. Manipulation of the gut microbiome with antibiotics resulted in a
dramatic decrease in both the number and size of tumors. Our results demonstrate 
that changes in the gut microbiome associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis
directly contribute to tumorigenesis and suggest that interventions affecting the
composition of the microbiome may be a strategy to prevent the development of
colon cancer.IMPORTANCE: The trillions of bacteria that live in the gut, known
collectively as the gut microbiome, are important for normal functioning of the
intestine. There is now growing evidence that disruptive changes in the gut
microbiome are strongly associated with the development colorectal cancer.
However, how the gut microbiome changes with time during tumorigenesis and
whether these changes directly contribute to disease have not been determined. We
demonstrate using a mouse model of inflammation-driven colon cancer that there
are dramatic, continual alterations in the microbiome during the development of
tumors, which are directly responsible for tumor development. Our results suggest
that interventions that target these changes in the microbiome may be an
effective strategy for preventing the development of colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: A clinical study was designed that aimed to analyze whether resection
of the large bowel in cancer patients might benefit diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: This prospective case-control study included retrospective information. 
Patients (n = 247) included diabetic and euglycemic groups with colorectal cancer
operations (n = 60), cancer gastrectomy (n = 72), exclusive chemoradiotherapy for
rectal cancer (n = 46), and noncancer clinical controls (n = 69). Follow-up
periods were, respectively, 79.2 ± 27.4, 86.8 ± 25.1, 70.0 ± 26.3, and 85.1 ±
18.2 months (NS). Diabetes groups included patients with prediabetes.
RESULTS: Diabetes remission, defined as conversion from diabetes to prediabetes
or from this condition to normal, was documented in, respectively, 32.4 % (11 of 
34), 41.2 % (14 of 34), 7.1 % (1 of 14), and 7.7 % (3 of 39) in the four cohorts 
(P = 0.004). Within the same period, progression of euglycemic participants to
diabetes occurred in 30.8 % (8 of 26), 63.2 % (24 of 38), 25.0 (8 of 32), and
20.0 % (6 of 30) (P = 0.028). Diabetes amelioration was associated with weight
loss in gastrectomy patients but not in the other groups. Dietary intake,
estimated in the two surgical populations, did not predict outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes amelioration after colorectal interventions was
demonstrated, but progression of euglycemic patients toward prediabetes was not
changed in comparison with nonsurgical controls. It is speculated that reshaping 
of the bowel microbiome or hormone changes after colorectal interventions
underlay the improvement in diabetes. Body weight fluctuations could not be
incriminated in this investigation.

Enterotoxigenic anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis is a significant source of
inflammatory diarrheal disease and a risk factor for colorectal cancer. Two
distinct metalloproteinase types (the homologous 1, 2, and 3 isoforms of
fragilysin (FRA1, FRA2, and FRA3, respectively) and metalloproteinase II (MPII)) 
are encoded by the B. fragilis pathogenicity island. FRA was demonstrated to be
important to pathogenesis, whereas MPII, also a potential virulence protein,
remained completely uncharacterized. Here, we, for the first time, extensively
characterized MPII in comparison with FRA3, a representative of the FRA isoforms.
We employed a series of multiplexed peptide cleavage assays to determine
substrate specificity and proteolytic characteristics of MPII and FRA. These
results enabled implementation of an efficient assay of MPII activity using a
fluorescence-quenched peptide and contributed to structural evidence for the
distinct substrate cleavage preferences of MPII and FRA. Our data imply that MPII
specificity mimics the dibasic Arg↓Arg cleavage motif of furin-like proprotein
convertases, whereas the cleavage motif of FRA (Pro-X-X-Leu-(Arg/Ala/Leu)↓)
resembles that of human matrix metalloproteinases. To the best of our knowledge, 
MPII is the first zinc metalloproteinase with the dibasic cleavage preferences,
suggesting a high level of versatility of metalloproteinase proteolysis. Based on
these data, we now suggest that the combined (rather than individual) activity of
MPII and FRA is required for the overall B. fragilis virulence in vivo.

Although probiotics have shown success in preventing the development of
experimental colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC), beneficial effects of
interventional treatment are relatively unknown. Here we show that interventional
treatment with VSL#3 probiotic alters the luminal and mucosally-adherent
microbiota, but does not protect against inflammation or tumorigenesis in the
azoxymethane (AOM)/Il10⁻/⁻ mouse model of colitis-associated CRC. VSL#3
(10⁹ CFU/animal/day) significantly enhanced tumor penetrance, multiplicity,
histologic dysplasia scores, and adenocarcinoma invasion relative to
VSL#3-untreated mice. Illumina 16S sequencing demonstrated that VSL#3
significantly decreased (16-fold) the abundance of a bacterial taxon assigned to 
genus Clostridium in the mucosally-adherent microbiota. Mediation analysis by
linear models suggested that this taxon was a contributing factor to increased
tumorigenesis in VSL#3-fed mice. We conclude that VSL#3 interventional therapy
can alter microbial community composition and enhance tumorigenesis in the
AOM/Il10⁻/⁻ model.

Increasing evidence links the gut microbiota with colorectal cancer. Metagenomic 
analyses indicate that symbiotic Fusobacterium spp. are associated with human
colorectal carcinoma, but whether this is an indirect or causal link remains
unclear. We find that Fusobacterium spp. are enriched in human colonic adenomas
relative to surrounding tissues and in stool samples from colorectal adenoma and 
carcinoma patients compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, in the Apc(Min/+) 
mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis, Fusobacterium nucleatum increases tumor 
multiplicity and selectively recruits tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, which can
promote tumor progression. Tumors from Apc(Min/+) mice exposed to F. nucleatum
exhibit a proinflammatory expression signature that is shared with human
fusobacteria-positive colorectal carcinomas. However, unlike other bacteria
linked to colorectal carcinoma, F. nucleatum does not exacerbate colitis,
enteritis, or inflammation-associated intestinal carcinogenesis. Collectively,
these data suggest that, through recruitment of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, 
fusobacteria generate a proinflammatory microenvironment that is conducive for
colorectal neoplasia progression.

In this study we used stool profiling to identify intestinal bacteria and
metabolites that are differentially represented in humans with colorectal cancer 
(CRC) compared to healthy controls to identify how microbial functions may
influence CRC development. Stool samples were collected from healthy adults
(n = 10) and colorectal cancer patients (n = 11) prior to colon resection surgery
at the University of Colorado Health-Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, CO. 
The V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene was pyrosequenced and both short chain fatty
acids and global stool metabolites were extracted and analyzed utilizing Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). There were no significant differences
in the overall microbial community structure associated with the disease state,
but several bacterial genera, particularly butyrate-producing species, were
under-represented in the CRC samples, while a mucin-degrading species,
Akkermansia muciniphila, was about 4-fold higher in CRC (p<0.01). Proportionately
higher amounts of butyrate were seen in stool of healthy individuals while
relative concentrations of acetate were higher in stools of CRC patients. GC-MS
profiling revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples from CRC
patients and higher poly and monounsaturated fatty acids and ursodeoxycholic
acid, a conjugated bile acid in stool samples from healthy adults (p<0.01).
Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential
relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species. These
associations could provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer
environment and will help direct future mechanistic studies. Using integrated
"omics" approaches may prove a useful tool in identifying functional groups of
gastrointestinal bacteria and their associated metabolites as novel therapeutic
and chemopreventive targets.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a frequently used osmotic laxative that accelerates 
gastrointestinal transit. It has remained unclear, however, whether PEG affects
intestinal functions. We aimed to determine the effect of PEG treatment on
intestinal sterol metabolism. Rats were treated with PEG in drinking water (7%)
for 2 wk or left untreated (controls). We studied the enterohepatic circulation
of the major bile salt (BS) cholate with a plasma stable isotope dilution
technique and determined BS profiles and concentrations in bile, intestinal lumen
contents, and feces. We determined the fecal excretion of cholesterol plus its
intestinally formed metabolites. Finally, we determined the cytolytic activity of
fecal water (a surrogate marker of colorectal cancer risk) and the amount and
composition of fecal microbiota. Compared with control rats, PEG treatment
increased the pool size (+51%; P < 0.01) and decreased the fractional turnover of
cholate (-32%; P < 0.01). PEG did not affect the cholate synthesis rate,
corresponding with an unaffected fecal primary BS excretion. PEG reduced fecal
excretion of secondary BS and of cholesterol metabolites (each P < 0.01). PEG
decreased the cytolytic activity of fecal water [54 (46-62) vs. 87 (85-92)%
erythrocyte potassium release in PEG-treated and control rats, respectively; P < 
0.01]. PEG treatment increased the contribution of Verrucomicrobia (P < 0.01) and
decreased that of Firmicutes (P < 0.01) in fecal flora. We concluded that PEG
treatment changes the intestinal bacterial composition, decreases the bacterial
dehydroxylation of primary BS and the metabolism of cholesterol, and increases
the pool size of the primary BS cholate in rats.

BACKGROUND: There have been very few detailed reports of the intestinal
environment after surgical treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC). We analysed
faecal microbiota, organic acids and pH to investigate the influence of
colorectal surgery on the intestinal environment.
METHODS: Faecal samples from 81 CRC patients were collected before the start of
pre-operative preparation the day before surgery, as well as 7 days or more after
surgery. Thirteen groups of intestinal microbiota, eight types of organic acids, 
and pH were measured using 16S rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative
PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography and a pH meter, respectively.
RESULTS: Total bacterial counts (10.3 ± 0.6 vs. 9.4 ± 1.2 log10 cells/g;
p < 0.001) and the numbers of 6 groups of obligate anaerobes were significantly
decreased after surgery. In contrast, the populations of Enterobacteriaceae,
Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas were significantly increased.
Post-operatively, the concentration of total organic acids was lower (77.9 ± 40.1
vs. 50.1 ± 37.0 μmol/g; p < 0.001) than the pre-operative concentration, and a
significant reduction in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was observed.
CONCLUSION: Significant changes in the intestinal environment, including marked
decreases in obligate anaerobes, increases in pathogenic bacteria, and reductions
in SCFAs, were detected after surgery for CRC.

The gut flora is composed of a huge number of diverse, well-adapted symbionts
that interact with epithelial lining throughout the host's entire life. Not all
commensals have the same ability to maintain quiescent, protective inflammation. 
Importantly, instability in the composition of gut microbial communities
(referred to as dysbiosis) has been linked to loss of gut barrier in the context 
of common human illnesses with increasing socio-economic impacts, such as Crohn
disease and colorectal cancer. Our recent findings suggest that
disease-predisposing dysbiosis can now be intentionally manipulated by targeting 
the major Crohn disease-predisposing NOD2 gene. That knowledge will not only add 
a new dimension to the often overlooked microbiology of Crohn disease and
colorectal cancer, but will also have a broad impact on biomedical sciences
worldwide.

Reduced susceptibility to sporadic colorectal cancer in native Africans (NA) is
correlated with low consumption of animal products and greater microbial
production of colonic methane. In this context, two hydrogenotrophic microbial
groups are of interest, methanogenic Archaea (MA) utilizing H2 to produce methane
and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) generating hydrogen sulfide, which has been
linked with chronic inflammatory disorders of the colon. In the present study,
stool samples from NA, consuming a diet high in resistant starch and low in
animal products, and from African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA),
both consuming a typical Western diet, were examined for genetic diversity and
structure of Archaea, MA and SRB communities. In general, a greater proportion of
NA than AA and EA harboured the full range of targeted hydrogenotrophic groups.
Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rRNA genes and 
specific functional genes, combined with multivariate statistical analyses,
revealed that NA harboured more diverse and different Archaea and MA populations 
than AA and EA. Also, NA harboured significantly distinct SRB populations
compared with AA and EA. Taken together, these data are consistent with diet
selecting for distinct hydrogenotrophic microbiota.

The human gut microbiota is a complex system that is essential to the health of
the host. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may play an
important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we 
used pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region to characterize the fecal
microbiota of 19 patients with CRC and 20 healthy control subjects. The results
revealed striking differences in fecal microbial population patterns between
these two groups. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed that 17
phylotypes closely related to Bacteroides were enriched in the gut microbiota of 
CRC patients, whereas nine operational taxonomic units, represented by the
butyrate-producing genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, were significantly less
abundant. A positive correlation was observed between the abundance of
Bacteroides species and CRC disease status (R = 0.462, P = 0.046 < 0.5). In
addition, 16 genera were significantly more abundant in CRC samples than in
controls, including potentially pathogenic Fusobacterium and Campylobacter
species at genus level. The dysbiosis of fecal microbiota, characterized by the
enrichment of potential pathogens and the decrease in butyrate-producing members,
may therefore represent a specific microbial signature of CRC. A greater
understanding of the dynamics of the fecal microbiota may assist in the
development of novel fecal microbiome-related diagnostic tools for CRC.

The microbiota is pivotal in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD)-associated inflammation-induced colorectal cancer (CRC), yet mechanisms for
these effects remain poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that aberrant
inflammasome-induced microbiota plays a critical role in CRC development, where
mice deficient in the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 (NLRP6) 
inflammasome feature enhanced inflammation-induced CRC formation. Intriguingly,
WT mice cohoused either with inflammasome-deficient mice or with mice lacking
IL-18 feature exacerbated inflammation-induced CRC compared with singly housed WT
mice. Enhanced tumorigenesis is dependent on microbiota-induced chemokine (C-C
motif) ligand 5 (CCL5)-driven inflammation, which in turn promotes epithelial
cell proliferation through local activation of the IL-6 pathway, leading to
cancer formation. Altogether, our results mechanistically link the altered
microbiota with the pathogenesis of inflammation-induced CRC and suggest that in 
some conditions, microbiota components may transfer CRC susceptibility between
individuals.

Recent studies suggest that biofluid-based metabonomics may identify metabolite
markers promising for colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. We report here a
follow-up replication study, after a previous CRC metabonomics study, aiming to
identify a distinct serum metabolic signature of CRC with diagnostic potential.
Serum metabolites from newly diagnosed CRC patients (N = 101) and healthy
subjects (N = 102) were profiled using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS). Differential metabolites were
identified with statistical tests of orthogonal partial
least-squares-discriminant analysis (VIP > 1) and the Mann-Whitney U test (p <
0.05). With a total of 249 annotated serum metabolites, we were able to
differentiate CRC patients from the healthy controls using an orthogonal partial 
least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) in a learning sample set of 62 CRC 
patients and 62 matched healthy controls. This established model was able to
correctly assign the rest of the samples to the CRC or control groups in a
validation set of 39 CRC patients and 40 healthy controls. Consistent with our
findings from the previous study, we observed a distinct metabolic signature in
CRC patients including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, glutamine,
fatty acids, and gut flora metabolism. Our results demonstrated that a panel of
serum metabolite markers is of great potential as a noninvasive diagnostic method
for the detection of CRC.

markers of risk for colon cancer in humans.

The purpose of this study was to determine in healthy humans whether First Leaf
(FL; composed of blackcurrant extract powder, lactoferrin and lutein) and Cassis 
Anthomix 30 (CAM30; blackcurrant extract powder) can positively modify the
colonic microbiota by enhancing the growth of the beneficial bacteria and
inactivating the toxic bacterial enzymes which are known to be involved in
colonic carcinogenesis. Thirty healthy adult male and female volunteers were
recruited for this study. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was carried out to
analyse the populations of fecal microbiota. Consumption of FL and CAM30 led to
significant increases (P < 0.0001) in the population sizes of lactobacilli and
bifidobacteria whereas the population sizes of Clostridium spp. and Bacteroides
spp were decreased significantly (P < 0.0001). In addition, feeding of FL and
CAM30 decreases the activity of β-glucuronidase (bacterial enzyme which is
considered to be one of the enzymes that increases risk for colorectal cancer)
and significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the fecal pH. In conclusion, the results
of this study open up the possibility that consumption of FL and CAM30 can offer 
various benefits to human health through acting as novel prebiotic agents via
increasing the numbers of beneficial bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria)
in the gut.

A novel method for the culture and polarized stimulation of human intestinal
mucosa explants.

Few models currently exist to realistically simulate the complex human
intestine's micro-environment, where a variety of interactions take place. Proper
homeostasis directly depends on these interactions, as they shape an entire
immunological response inducing tolerance against food antigens while at the same
time mounting effective immune responses against pathogenic microbes accidentally
ingested with food. Intestinal homeostasis is preserved also through various
complex interactions between the microbiota (including food-associated beneficial
bacterial strains) and the host, that regulate the attachment/degradation of
mucus, the production of antimicrobial peptides by the epithelial barrier, and
the "education" of epithelial cells' that controls the tolerogenic or immunogenic
phenotype of unique, gut-resident lymphoid cells' populations. These interactions
have been so far very difficult to reproduce with in vitro assays using either
cultured cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, mouse
models differ substantially in components of the intestinal mucosa (mucus layer
organization, commensal bacteria community) with respect to the human gut. Thus, 
studies of a variety of treatments to be brought in the clinics for important
stress-related or pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome,
inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer have been difficult to carry out.
To address these issues, we developed a novel system that enables us to stimulate
explants of human intestinal mucosa that retain their in situ conditioning by the
host microbiota and immune response, in a polarized fashion. Polarized apical
stimulation is of great importance for the outcome of the elicited immune
response. It has been repeatedly shown that the same stimuli can produce
completely different responses when they bypass the apical face of the intestinal
epithelium, stimulating epithelial cells basolaterally or coming into direct
contact with lamina propria components, switching the phenotype from tolerogenic 
to immunogenic and causing unnecessary and excessive inflammation in the area. We
achieved polarized stimulation by gluing a cave cylinder which delimited the area
of stimulation on the apical face of the mucosa as will be described in the
protocol. We used this model to examine, among others, differential effects of
three different Lactobacilli strains. We show that this model system is very
powerful to assess the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics in healthy and
disease conditions.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is posing an increasingly important burden on the health 
care system, with western countries seeing a growing incidence of the disease.
Except for germline DNA mutations which have been attributed to less than 5% of
patients, little is known about the main causes of CRC. However, environment
factors such as food, lifestyle and medication are now suspected to have a major 
influence on inducing cancers. Today, exhaustive quantitative and qualitative
evaluation of all environmental factors is not possible. Various
environment-induced diseases have been characterized based on colon microflora,
also called microbiota, analyses. Growing data have shown specific changes in
microflora (i.e. dysbiosis) in the stools of patients with colon cancer or those 
adherent to the colonic mucosa. Thus, it appears that microbiota may be
considered a platform offering host and environment interactions for studying
CRCs. The hypothesis that colon cancer might be a bacteria-related disease is
suggested and perspectives are discussed.

At a simplistic level, colorectal cancer arises from mutations in various
proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Aside from genetically inherited
factors, environmental, lifestyle, and dietary habits have all been identified as
risk agents promoting mutational events leading to the development of colorectal 
cancer. This "In Focus" presents evidence that the intestinal endogenous
bacterial community represents a risk factor for the development of colorectal
cancer.

Disease, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that diet is one of the most
important environmental factors involved in the progression from advanced
colorectal adenoma (A-CRA) to colorectal cancer.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the possible effects of dietary fiber on the fecal
microbiota of patients with A-CRA.
DESIGN: Patients with a diagnosis of A-CRA by pathological examination were
enrolled in the A-CRA group. Patients with no obvious abnormalities or
histopathological changes were enrolled in the healthy control (HC) group.
Dietary fiber intake was assessed in all patients. Short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) in feces were detected by gas chromatography. The fecal microbiota
community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing based on 16S ribosomal RNA.
RESULTS: Lower dietary fiber patterns and consistently lower SCFA production were
observed in the A-CRA group (n = 344). Principal component analysis showed
distinct differences in the fecal microbiota communities of the 2 groups.
Clostridium, Roseburia, and Eubacterium spp. were significantly less prevalent in
the A-CRA group (n = 47) than in the HC group (n = 47), whereas Enterococcus and 
Streptococcus spp. were more prevalent in the A-CRA group (n = 47) (all P <
0.05). Butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria were more prevalent in a subgroup
of HC subjects with a high fiber intake than in those in both the low-fiber HC
subgroup and the high-fiber A-CRA subgroup (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A high-fiber dietary pattern and subsequent consistent production of 
SCFAs and healthy gut microbiota are associated with a reduced risk of A-CRA.

The microbiome has captured the attention of scientists from multiple research
fields including ecology, immunology, microbiology and cancer biology. The
microbial community living in the gastrointestinal tract is the most abundant and
diverse niche of the human body and it is not surprising that microbiome research
has predominantly focused upon this organ system. In this addendum, we summarize 
the latest developments in microbiome research on inflammatory bowel diseases and
colorectal cancer. In addition, we highlight our recent findings that chronic
intestinal inflammation modulates microbial community composition and the
development of colorectal cancer. Our findings redefine the paradigm of
inflammation-associated cancer by illuminating the key role of bacteria in
development of colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to expand existing knowledge about the
CRC-associated microbiome among Han Chinese, and to further discover the
variation pattern of the human CRC microbiome across all population.
FINDINGS: Using pyrosequencing-based molecular monitoring of bacterial 16S rRNA
gene from eight tumor/normal tissue pairs of eight Chinese CRC patients, we
analyzed and characterized the basic features of the CRC-associated microbiome.
Firstly, we discovered an increasing diversity among tumor-associated bacterial
communities. Secondly, in 50% of Chinese CRC patients, we found a significant
increase of Roseburia (P = 0.017), and a concurrent decrease of both
Microbacterium (P = 0.009) and Anoxybacillus (P = 0.009) in tumor tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a novel CRC microbiome pattern in Chinese. Both the
over-represented Roseburia bacteria at tumor sites and the over-represented
Microbacterium and Anoxybacillus bacteria away from tumor sites were both closely
related in Chinese CRC patients. Across several populations reported in this
study and previously, we observed both common and distinctive patterns of human
CRC microbiome's association with a high-risk of CRC.

The mTOR Pathway and the Role of Energy Balance Throughout Life in Colorectal
Cancer Etiology and Prognosis: Unravelling Mechanisms Through a Multidimensional

Biology, Maastricht University, P.O. Box 616, Maastricht, 6200 MD The
Netherlands.

Timing of exposure to lifestyle factors that influence energy balance may
differentially affect colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and prognosis. Caloric
restriction in youth and short stature, as markers of early-life exposures, have 
shown to decrease CRC risk, whereas large body size and low physical activity
levels in adulthood are established risk factors for CRC. Regarding prognosis,
overweight, sarcopenia, and their co-occurrence (sarcopenic obesity) may
negatively influence the health and quality of life of CRC survivors. There is
mechanistic support for disruption of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway as an underlying mechanism possibly driving these associations, because
mTOR integrates signals from growth factors, nutrients, mutagens, and hormones to
induce cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and autophagy. However,
epidemiologic evidence connecting mTOR to energy-balance-related CRC throughout
the lifespan is scarce. This perspective proposes how multidimensional molecular 
epidemiologic studies can shed light on the etiology and prognosis of
energy-balance-related CRC.

The human gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a player in colorectal
cancer (CRC). While particular imbalances in the gut microbiota have been linked 
to colorectal adenomas and cancer, no specific bacterium has been identified as a
risk factor. Recent studies have reported a high abundance of Fusobacterium in
CRC subjects compared to normal subjects, but this observation has not been
reported for adenomas, CRC precursors. We assessed the abundance of Fusobacterium
species in the normal rectal mucosa of subjects with (n = 48) and without
adenomas (n = 67). We also confirmed previous reports on Fusobacterium and CRC in
10 CRC tumor tissues and 9 matching normal tissues by pyrosequencing. We
extracted DNA from rectal mucosal biopsies and measured bacterial levels by
quantitative PCR of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Local cytokine gene expression
was also determined in mucosal biopsies from adenoma cases and controls by
quantitative PCR. The mean log abundance of Fusobacterium or cytokine gene
expression between cases and controls was compared by t-test. Logistic regression
was used to compare tertiles of Fusobacterium abundance. Adenoma subjects had a
significantly higher abundance of Fusobacterium species compared to controls (p =
0.01). Compared to the lowest tertile, subjects with high abundance of
Fusobacterium were significantly more likely to have adenomas (OR 3.66, 95% CI
1.37-9.74, p-trend 0.005). Cases but not controls had a significant positive
correlation between local cytokine gene expression and Fusobacterium abundance.
Among cases, the correlation for local TNF-α and Fusobacterium was r = 0.33, p = 
0.06 while it was 0.44, p = 0.01 for Fusobacterium and IL-10. These results
support a link between the abundance of Fusobacterium in colonic mucosa and
adenomas and suggest a possible role for mucosal inflammation in this process.

BACKGROUND: New molecular biology-based methods of bacterial identification are
expected to help elucidate the relationship between colorectal cancer (CRC) and
intestinal microbiota. Although there is increasing evidence revealing the
potential role of microbiota in CRC, it remains unclear whether microbial
dysbiosis is the cause or the result of CRC onset.
AIM: We investigated the changes of intestinal environments in CRC or adenoma.
METHODS: We analyzed 13 groups of microbiota, 8 types of organic acids, and pH in
feces obtained from the following 3 groups: individuals with CRC, adenoma, and
non-adenoma. Ninety-three patients with CRC and 49 healthy individuals (22 with
adenoma and 27 without adenoma) were enrolled.
RESULTS: The counts of total bacteria (10.3 ± 0.7 vs. 10.8 ± 0.3 log10 cells/g of
feces; p < 0.001), 5 groups of obligate anaerobe, and 2 groups of facultative
anaerobes were significantly lower in the CRC group than in the healthy
individuals. While the concentrations of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were
significantly decreased in the CRC group, the pH was increased in the CRC group
(7.4 ± 0.8 vs. 6.9 ± 0.6; p < 0.001). Comparison among the CRC, adenoma, and
non-adenoma groups revealed that fecal SCFAs and pH in the adenoma group were
intermediate to the CRC group and the non-adenoma group. Within the CRC group, no
differences in microbiota or organic acids were observed among Dukes stages.
CONCLUSIONS: CRC patients showed significant differences in the intestinal
environment, including alterations of microbiota, decreased SCFAs, and elevated
pH. These changes are not a result of CRC progression but are involved in CRC
onset.

    Cancer Discov. 2013 Mar;3(3):OF17.

Instability in the composition of gut bacterial communities (dysbiosis) has been 
linked to common human intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease and
colorectal cancer. Here, we show that dysbiosis caused by Nod2 deficiency gives
rise to a reversible, communicable risk of colitis and colitis-associated
carcinogenesis in mice. Loss of either Nod2 or RIP2 resulted in a proinflammatory
microenvironment that enhanced epithelial dysplasia following chemically induced 
injury. The condition could be improved by treatment with antibiotics or an
anti-interleukin-6 receptor-neutralizing antibody. Genotype-dependent disease
risk was communicable via maternally transmitted microbiota in both
Nod2-deficient and WT hosts. Furthermore, reciprocal microbiota transplantation
reduced disease risk in Nod2-deficient mice and led to long-term changes in
intestinal microbial communities. Conversely, disease risk was enhanced in WT
hosts that were recolonized with dysbiotic fecal microbiota from Nod2-deficient
mice. Thus, we demonstrated that licensing of dysbiotic microbiota is a critical 
component of disease risk. Our results demonstrate that NOD2 has an unexpected
role in shaping a protective assembly of gut bacterial communities and suggest
that manipulation of dysbiosis is a potential therapeutic approach in the
treatment of human intestinal disorders.

disease.

Sulfur is both crucial to life and a potential threat to health. While colonic
sulfur metabolism mediated by eukaryotic cells is relatively well studied, much
less is known about sulfur metabolism within gastrointestinal microbes. Sulfated 
compounds in the colon are either of inorganic (e.g., sulfates, sulfites) or
organic (e.g., dietary amino acids and host mucins) origin. The most extensively 
studied of the microbes involved in colonic sulfur metabolism are the
sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), which are common colonic inhabitants. Many other
microbial pathways are likely to shape colonic sulfur metabolism as well as the
composition and availability of sulfated compounds, and these interactions need
to be examined in more detail. Hydrogen sulfide is the sulfur derivative that has
attracted the most attention in the context of colonic health, and the extent to 
which it is detrimental or beneficial remains in debate. Several lines of
evidence point to SRB or exogenous hydrogen sulfide as potential players in the
etiology of intestinal disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and
colorectal cancer in particular. Generation of hydrogen sulfide via pathways
other than dissimilatory sulfate reduction may be as, or more, important than
those involving the SRB. We suggest here that a novel axis of research is to
assess the effects of hydrogen sulfide in shaping colonic microbiome structure.
Clearly, in-depth characterization of the microbial pathways involved in colonic 
sulfur metabolism is necessary for a better understanding of its contribution to 
colonic disorders and development of therapeutic strategies.

OBJECTIVE: This paper provides an overview of Desulfovibrio (DSV) incidence and
its effect on bacterial diversity in human gastrointestinal tract of four groups:
ulcerative colitis (UC), colorectal cancer (CRC), polypus (PP) and the healthy
control (H).
METHODS: Real time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) assays were used to
enumerate DSV in gastrointestinal tract of 58 subjects. Diversity of gut
microbiota was analyzed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE)
and 16S rRNA V3 sequencing.
RESULTS: RT-PCR detected DSV in all samples. Significantly increased numbers of
DSV were observed for UC and PP groups compared with CRC and H groups. No
significant difference was observed for CRC and H groups with gene copy numbers
of DSV. Alterations of DSV and gut microbiota were observed in disease groups.
CONCLUSION: We found that quantity and diversity of DSV are significantly
increased in UC and PP compared to controls. The increased numbers of DSV in
disease groups suggests a possible harmful role.

humans and mice.

SMAD4 is a common mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. One of the members 
of this pathway, TGF-beta 1, has an important role in controlling gut
inflammation in relation to the continuous stimulation of the intestinal
microbiota. SMAD4 haploinsufficiency in humans has been linked to juvenile
polyposis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (JP/HHT; OMIM#17505).
Hematochezia and colonic mucosal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD) have been reported in JP/HHT. Stimulated by recent experience with
two affected pediatric patients presented here, we explored the potential role of
Smad4 haploinsufficiency in a murine model of colonic inflammation. Smad4(+/-)
mice were maintained on a mixed C57/129SvEv background. Chronic colitis was
induced with repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking 
water. The colonic mucosal microbiota was interrogated by massively parallel
pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 66.7% of Smad4(+/-) mice were
sensitive to DSS colitis compared to 14.3% of wild type (Chi-Square p=0.036). The
augmented colitis was associated with microbiota separation in the Smad4(+/-)
mice. Enterococcus and Enterococcus faecalis specifically was increased in
abundance in the colitis-prone animals. Smad4 haploinsufficiency can associate
with increased susceptibility to large bowel inflammation in mammals with
variable penetrance in association with the colonic mucosal microbiota. These
findings may reveal implications not only towards colonic inflammation in the
setting of SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, but for colorectal cancer as well.

GOALS: To investigate the association of colonic methane, formed by methanogenic 
achaea, and pH with gastrointestinal symptoms during colorectal cancer
chemotherapy.
BACKGROUND: Adjuvant 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy reduces recurrences in
colorectal cancer, but causes severe gastrointestinal toxicity, partly related to
disturbed intestinal microbiota.
STUDY: Resected colorectal cancer patients (n=143) were analyzed for colonic
methanogenesis and pH before and during the 24 weeks of 5-fluorouracil
chemotherapy and for gastrointestinal symptoms during chemotherapy. This study
was performed within the setting of an intervention study on the effects of
Lactobacillus on chemotherapy-related gastrointestinal toxicity. The site of
resected cancer, resection type, stoma, chemotherapy regimen, hypolactasia, and
Lactobacillus intervention were considered as possible confounding factors, and
multivariate models were constructed.
RESULTS: Baseline methane producers had less frequent diarrhea (more than or
equal to moderate) during chemotherapy than nonproducers [odds ratio (OR), 0.42; 
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20 to 0.88; P=0.022] and more frequent
constipation (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 2.01 to 10.32; P<0.001). Baseline fecal pH was
also associated with symptoms during chemotherapy; higher the pH, the lower the
risk of diarrhea (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.02; P=0.058) and higher the risk of
constipation (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.35 to 3.68; P=0.002). In multivariate stepwise 
models, methanogenesis was a significant explaining factor with inverse
association with diarrhea and positive association with constipation. Fecal pH,
which was significantly associated with methane production, was no longer a
significant explaining factor when methanogensis was included in the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Methane producer status has a role in determining whether patient
experiences diarrhea or constipation during 5-fluorouracil therapy. This
underscores the importance of intestinal microbiota in the development of
intestinal toxicity during 5-fluorouracil therapy.

There is growing evidence the microbiota of the large bowel may influence the
risk of developing colorectal cancer as well as other diseases including type-1
diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome. Current
sampling methods to obtain microbial specimens, such as feces and mucosal
biopsies, are inconvenient and unappealing to patients. Obtaining samples through
rectal swabs could prove to be a quicker and relatively easier method, but it is 
unclear if swabs are an adequate substitute. We compared bacterial diversity and 
composition from rectal swabs and rectal mucosal biopsies in order to examine the
viability of rectal swabs as an alternative to biopsies. Paired rectal swabs and 
mucosal biopsy samples were collected in un-prepped participants (n = 11) and
microbial diversity was characterized by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length
polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbial community composition from swab samples was
different from rectal mucosal biopsies (p = 0.001). Overall the bacterial
diversity was higher in swab samples than in biopsies as assessed by diversity
indexes such as: richness (p = 0.01), evenness (p = 0.06) and Shannon's diversity
(p = 0.04). Analysis of specific bacterial groups by qPCR showed higher copy
number of Lactobacillus (p < 0.0001) and Eubacteria (p = 0.0003) in swab samples 
compared with biopsies. Our findings suggest that rectal swabs and rectal mucosal
samples provide different views of the microbiota in the large intestine.

Inflammation alters host physiology to promote cancer, as seen in
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we identify the intestinal
microbiota as a target of inflammation that affects the progression of CRC.
High-throughput sequencing revealed that inflammation modifies gut microbial
composition in colitis-susceptible interleukin-10-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mice.
Monocolonization with the commensal Escherichia coli NC101 promoted invasive
carcinoma in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated Il10(-/-) mice. Deletion of the
polyketide synthase (pks) genotoxic island from E. coli NC101 decreased tumor
multiplicity and invasion in AOM/Il10(-/-) mice, without altering intestinal
inflammation. Mucosa-associated pks(+) E. coli were found in a significantly high
percentage of inflammatory bowel disease and CRC patients. This suggests that in 
mice, colitis can promote tumorigenesis by altering microbial composition and
inducing the expansion of microorganisms with genotoxic capabilities.

Recent reports have suggested the involvement of gut microbiota in the
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). We utilized pyrosequencing based analysis
of 16S rRNA genes to determine the overall structure of microbiota in patients
with colorectal cancer and healthy controls; we investigated microbiota of the
intestinal lumen, the cancerous tissue and matched noncancerous normal tissue.
Moreover, we investigated the mucosa-adherent microbial composition using rectal 
swab samples because the structure of the tissue-adherent bacterial community is 
potentially altered following bowel cleansing. Our findings indicated that the
microbial structure of the intestinal lumen and cancerous tissue differed
significantly. Phylotypes that enhance energy harvest from diets or perform
metabolic exchange with the host were more abundant in the lumen. There were more
abundant Firmicutes and less abundant Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in lumen. 
The overall microbial structures of cancerous tissue and noncancerous tissue were
similar; however the tumor microbiota exhibited lower diversity. The structures
of the intestinal lumen microbiota and mucosa-adherent microbiota were different 
in CRC patients compared to matched microbiota in healthy individuals.
Lactobacillales was enriched in cancerous tissue, whereas Faecalibacterium was
reduced. In the mucosa-adherent microbiota, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium,
and Blautia were reduced in CRC patients, whereas Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas,
Peptostreptococcus, and Mogibacterium were enriched. In the lumen, predominant
phylotypes related to metabolic disorders or metabolic exchange with the host,
Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Coriobacteriaceae were increased in
cancer patients. Coupled with previous reports, these results suggest that the
intestinal microbiota is associated with CRC risk and that intestinal lumen
microflora potentially influence CRC risk via cometabolism or metabolic exchange 
with the host. However, mucosa-associated microbiota potentially affects CRC risk
primarily through direct interaction with the host.

Differences in the composition of the gut microbial community have been
associated with diseases such as obesity, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
colorectal cancer (CRC). We used 454 titanium pyrosequencing of the V1-V2 region 
of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize adherent bacterial communities in mucosal
biopsy samples from 33 subjects with adenomas and 38 subjects without adenomas
(controls). Biopsy samples from subjects with adenomas had greater numbers of
bacteria from 87 taxa than controls; only 5 taxa were more abundant in control
samples. The magnitude of the differences in the distal gut microbiota between
patients with adenomas and controls was more pronounced than that of any other
clinical parameters including obesity, diet or family history of CRC. This
suggests that sequence analysis of the microbiota could be used to identify
patients at risk for developing adenomas.

Chronic intestinal inflammation: inflammatory bowel disease and
colitis-associated colon cancer.

Rubin DC(1), Shaker A, Levin MS.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington
University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory disorders of the intestine. The
prevalence in the United States is greater than 200 cases per 100,000, with the
total number of IBD patients between 1 and 1.5 million. CD may affect all parts
of the gastrointestinal tract, from mouth to anus, but most commonly involves the
distal part of the small intestine or ileum, and colon. UC results in colonic
inflammation that can affect the rectum only, or can progress proximally to
involve part of or the entire colon. Clinical symptoms include diarrhea,
abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and weight loss. A serious long-term
complication of chronic inflammation is the development of colorectal cancer. A
genetic basis for IBD had long been recognized based on the increased familial
risk. However, significant discordance for CD in twins, and a much less robust
phenotypic concordance for UC, suggested additional factors play a role in
disease pathogenesis, including environmental factors. In the past several years,
progress in understanding the molecular basis of IBD has accelerated, beginning
with the generation of animal models of colitis and progressing to the
identification of specific genetic markers from candidate gene, gene linkage, and
genome-wide association analyses. Genetic studies have also resulted in the
recognition of the importance of environmental factors, particularly the crucial 
role of the gut microbiota in CD and UC. Altered immune responses to the normal
intestinal flora are key factors in IBD pathogenesis. In this research topic, the
genetic basis of IBD, the genetic and cellular alterations associated with
colitis-associated colon cancer, and the emerging role of the intestinal
microbiota and other environmental factors will be reviewed.

Numerous studies support a role for the intestinal microbiota in colorectal
tumorigenesis. Although colon cancer has not yet been epidemiologically linked to
specific bacterial species, recent results suggest that certain toxigenic
commensal bacteria may be oncogenic Strains of Escherichia coli, a ubiquitous
member of the colonic flora, synthesize a genotoxin called colibactin. These
bacteria induce DNA double-strand breaks in intestinal cells and trigger
chromosomal instability, gene mutations and cell transformation. Thus, long-term 
colonization of the colon by rogue commensal bacteria capable of causing chronic 
DNA damage could contribute to the development of sporadic colorectal cancer.

Butyrate suppresses colonic inflammation through HDAC1-dependent Fas upregulation
and Fas-mediated apoptosis of T cells.

Butyrate, an intestinal microbiota metabolite of dietary fiber, has been shown to
exhibit protective effects toward inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative
colitis (UC) and inflammation-mediated colorectal cancer. Recent studies have
shown that chronic IFN-γ signaling plays an essential role in
inflammation-mediated colorectal cancer development in vivo, whereas genome-wide 
association studies have linked human UC risk loci to IFNG, the gene that encodes
IFN-γ. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the butyrate-IFN-γ-colonic
inflammation axis are not well defined. Here we showed that colonic mucosa from
patients with UC exhibit increased signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (STAT1) activation, and this STAT1 hyperactivation is correlated 
with increased T cell infiltration. Butyrate treatment-induced apoptosis of
wild-type T cells but not Fas-deficient (Fas(lpr)) or FasL-deficient (Fas(gld)) T
cells, revealing a potential role of Fas-mediated apoptosis of T cells as a
mechanism of butyrate function. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was found to bind
to the Fas promoter in T cells, and butyrate inhibits HDAC1 activity to induce
Fas promoter hyperacetylation and Fas upregulation in T cells. Knocking down
gpr109a or slc5a8, the genes that encode for receptor and transporter of
butyrate, respectively, resulted in altered expression of genes related to
multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, including inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), in mouse colonic epithelial cells in vivo. Butyrate effectively 
inhibited IFN-γ-induced STAT1 activation, resulting in inhibition of iNOS
upregulation in human colon epithelial and carcinoma cells in vitro. Our data
thus suggest that butyrate delivers a double-hit: induction of T cell apoptosis
to eliminate the source of inflammation and suppression of IFN-γ-mediated
inflammation in colonic epithelial cells, to suppress colonic inflammation.

Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a major contributor of human
colorectal cancer (CRC). While gut microbiota can trigger inflammation in the
intestinal tract, the precise signaling pathways through which host cells respond
to inflammatory bacterial stimulation are unclear. Here, we show that gut
microbiota enhances intestinal tumor load in the APC(Min/+) mouse model of CRC.
Furthermore, systemic anemia occurs coincident with rapid tumor growth,
suggesting a role for intestinal barrier damage and erythropoiesis-stimulating
mitogens. Short-term stimulation assays of murine colonic tumor cells reveal that
lipopolysaccharide, a microbial cell wall component, can accelerate cell growth
via a c-Jun/JNK activation pathway. Colonic tumors are also infiltrated by CD11b+
myeloid cells expressing high levels of phospho-STAT3 (p-Tyr705). Our results
implicate the role of gut microbiota, through triggering the c-Jun/JNK and STAT3 
signaling pathways in combination with anemia, in the acceleration of tumor
growth in APC(Min/+) mice.

Assessment of colorectal cancer molecular features along bowel subsites
challenges the conception of distinct dichotomy of proximal versus distal
colorectum.

OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer is typically classified into proximal colon, distal 
colon and rectal cancer. Tumour genetic and epigenetic features differ by tumour 
location. Considering a possible role of bowel contents (including microbiome) in
carcinogenesis, this study hypothesised that tumour molecular features might
gradually change along bowel subsites, rather than change abruptly at splenic
flexure.
DESIGN: Utilising 1443 colorectal cancers in two US nationwide prospective cohort
studies, the frequencies of molecular features (CpG island methylator phenotype
(CIMP), microsatellite instability (MSI), LINE-1 methylation and BRAF, KRAS and
PIK3CA mutations) were examined along bowel subsites (rectum, rectosigmoid
junction, sigmoid, descending colon, splenic flexure, transverse colon, hepatic
flexure, ascending colon and caecum). The linearity and non-linearity of
molecular relations along subsites were statistically tested by multivariate
logistic or linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: The frequencies of CIMP-high, MSI-high and BRAF mutations gradually
increased from the rectum (<2.3%) to ascending colon (36-40%), followed by falls 
in the caecum (12-22%). By linearity tests, these molecular relations were
significantly linear from rectum to ascending colon (p<0.0001), and there was
little evidence of non-linearity (p>0.09). Caecal cancers exhibited the highest
frequency of KRAS mutations (52% vs 27-35% in other sites; p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The frequencies of CIMP-high, MSI-high and BRAF mutations in cancer 
increased gradually along colorectum subsites from the rectum to ascending colon.
These novel data challenge the common conception of discrete molecular features
of proximal versus distal colorectal cancers, and have a substantial impact on
clinical, translational and epidemiology research, which has typically been
performed with the dichotomous classification of proximal versus distal tumours.

Ginsenoside compound K (C-K) is an intestinal microbiota metabolite of
ginsenoside Rb1, a major constituent in American ginseng. However, previous
ginseng anti-cancer observations were largely focused on ginseng parent compounds
but not metabolites, and anti-colorectal cancer studies on C-K were limited. This
study investigated the anti-proliferative effects of C-K when compared to those
of Rb1, and the related mechanisms of action, in HCT-116 and SW-480 colorectal
cancer cells. The effects of Rb1 and C-K on the proliferation of HCT-116 and
SW-480 human colorectal cancer cells were compared using an MTS assay. Cell cycle
and cell apoptosis were assayed using flow cytometry. Enzymatic activities of
caspases were determined by colorimetric assay, and interactions of C-K and
caspases were explored by docking analysis. C-K showed significant
anti-proliferative effects in HCT-116 and SW-480 cells at concentrations of 30-50
µM. At the same concentrations, Rb1 did not show any effects, while C-K arrested 
the cells in the G1 phase, and significantly induced cell apoptosis. Compared to 
HCT-116 (p53 wild-type), the p53 mutant cell line SW-480 was more sensitive to
C-K as assessed by cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction. C-K activated
expression of caspases 8 and 9, consistent with docking analysis. The docking
data suggested that C-K forms hydrogen bonds with Lys253, Thr904 and Gly362 in
caspase 8, and with Thr62, Ser63 and Arg207 in caspase 9. C-K, but not its parent
ginsenoside Rb1, showed significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects 
in human colorectal cancer cells. These results suggest that C-K could be a
potentially effective anti-colorectal cancer agent.

The gastrointestinal tract is the largest reservoir of commensal bacteria in the 
human body, providing nutrients and space for the survival of microbes while
concurrently operating mucosal barriers to confine the microbial population. The 
epithelial cells linked by tight junctions not only physically separate the
microbiota from the lamina propria, but also secrete proinflammatory cytokines
and reactive oxygen species in response to pathogen invasion and metabolic stress
and serve as a sentinel to the underlying immune cells. Accumulating evidence
indicates that commensal bacteria are involved in various physiological functions
in the gut and microbial imbalances (dysbiosis) may cause pathology. Commensal
bacteria are involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell turnover,
promotion of epithelial restitution and reorganization of tight junctions, all of
which are pivotal for fortifying barrier function. Recent studies indicate that
aberrant bacterial lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling in gut mucosa may be
involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Our
perception of enteric commensals has now changed from one of opportunistic
pathogens to active participants in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. This
review attempts to explain the dynamic interaction between the intestinal
epithelium and commensal bacteria in disease and health status.

The present report summarises key insights from a recent symposium focusing on
the impact of the intestinal microbiota on health and disease. A more appropriate
definition of health was proposed since health maintenance is a dynamic process
better assessed in terms of ability to adapt to stress and maintain physiological
homeostasis. Biomarkers specifically for health are needed; use of challenge
models and subjects with suboptimal health or specific disease risk were advised.
The complexity of interactions between external factors, the intestinal
epithelium, intestinal microbiota, the immune system and health was exemplified
by describing the effects of antibiotics, the Western diet and non-digestible
carbohydrates on the microbiota. The association of certain bacteria with
different states of health or disease was acknowledged but also that is not
always clear whether this is a cause or effect. Recent identification of three
robust faecal metagenome clusters may advance this understanding. It was
speculated that knowledge of the intestinal microbiota profile may eventually
help in the diagnosis of health risks and choice of therapy. It was agreed that
beneficial manipulation of the commensal microbiota can improve health outcome.
For this purpose, three areas were reviewed. Firstly, research into probiotics as
vaccine adjuvants was considered useful for substantiation of immune function
claims. Secondly, positive results with certain probiotics and synbiotics for
colorectal cancer are emerging, mostly from in vitro and animal studies. Finally,
studies in endurance athletes have shown strain-specific probiotic benefit in
terms of maintenance of immune function and, for certain strains, reduction of
episodes of respiratory and/or gastrointestinal tract infections.

Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) strains have been suggested to be
associated with acute and persistent diarrheal disease, inflammatory bowel
disease and colorectal cancer, although further epidemiological studies are
needed for clarification. Here, a pilot study was performed to examine the effect
of the oral administration of yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain on the 
cell numbers of fecal ETBF in a healthy population. Among 420 healthy adults, 38 
subjects were found to be ETBF carriers, giving a prevalence of approximately 9%.
Among them, 32 subjects were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel-group
study to ingest yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium
longum BB536 (BB536Y group), for 8 weeks, with milk provided to the control group
(milk group). The cell numbers of ETBF and the dominant species of the B.
fragilis group were measured by a quantitative PCR method. Compared with the
baseline values, there was a significant decrease in the cell number of ETBF at
week 8 in the BB536Y group but not in the milk group. Linear mixed models
analysis for longitudinal data revealed a significant difference in the changes
of ETBF cell number between the two groups during the intervention phase. These
results imply the potential of probiotic yogurt for eliminating ETBF in the
microbiota, but its clinical significance needs to be evaluated in the future.
This is the first report of a possible effect of probiotic intake on ETBF in the 
microbiota.

The tumor microenvironment of colorectal carcinoma is a complex community of
genomically altered cancer cells, nonneoplastic cells, and a diverse collection
of microorganisms. Each of these components may contribute to carcinogenesis;
however, the role of the microbiota is the least well understood. We have
characterized the composition of the microbiota in colorectal carcinoma using
whole genome sequences from nine tumor/normal pairs. Fusobacterium sequences were
enriched in carcinomas, confirmed by quantitative PCR and 16S rDNA sequence
analysis of 95 carcinoma/normal DNA pairs, while the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
phyla were depleted in tumors. Fusobacteria were also visualized within
colorectal tumors using FISH. These findings reveal alterations in the colorectal
cancer microbiota; however, the precise role of Fusobacteria in colorectal
carcinoma pathogenesis requires further investigation.

On the relationship between sialomucin and sulfomucin expression and
hydrogenotrophic microbes in the human colonic mucosa.

The colonic mucus layer is comprised primarily of acidomucins, which provide
viscous properties and can be broadly classified into sialomucins or sulfomucins 
based on the presence of terminating sialic acid or sulfate groups. Differences
in acidomucin chemotypes have been observed in diseases such as colorectal cancer
and inflammatory bowel disease, and variation in sialo- and sulfomucin content
may influence microbial colonization. For example, sulfate derived from
sulfomucin degradation may promote the colonization of sulfate-reducing bacteria 
(SRB), which through sulfate respiration generate the genotoxic gas hydrogen
sulfide. Here, paired biopsies from right colon, left colon, and rectum of 20
subjects undergoing routine screening colonoscopies were collected to enable
parallel histochemical and microbiological studies. Goblet cell sialo- and
sulfomucins in each biopsy were distinguished histochemically and quantified.
Quantitative PCR and multivariate analyses were used to examine the abundance of 
hydrogenotrophic microbial groups and SRB genera relative to acidomucin profiles.
Regional variation was observed in sialomucins and sulfomucins with the greatest 
abundance of each found in the rectum. Mucin composition did not appear to
influence the abundance of SRB or other hydrogenotrophic microbiota but
correlated with the composition of different SRB genera. A higher sulfomucin
proportion correlated with higher quantities of Desulfobacter, Desulfobulbus and 
Desulfotomaculum, relative to the predominant Desulfovibrio genus. Thus,
acidomucin composition may influence bacterial sulfate respiration in the human
colon, which may in turn impact mucosal homeostasis. These results stress the
need to consider mucus characteristics in the context of studies of the
microbiome that target intestinal diseases.

Evidence supports involvement of microflora in the transition of chronic
inflammation to neoplasia. We investigated the protective efficacy of the
probiotic VSL#3 in a model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Chronic
colitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by administration of trinitrobenzene
sulfonic acid (TNBS), followed 6 wk later by systemic reactivation. To induce
colitis-associated dysplasia and cancer, the animals received TNBS
(intravenously) twice a week for 10 wk. One group received VSL#3 in drinking
water from 1 wk before colitis induction until death. The colons were examined
for damage and presence of dysplasia or cancer. Samples were analyzed for cell
proliferation and apoptosis, vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, angiogenic
factors, and presence of alkaline sphingomyelinase or phosphatase. Microbial
community composition was evaluated by terminal restriction fragment-length
polymorphism analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. None of the
probiotic-treated animals developed carcinoma, and no high-grade dysplasia was
found in either the proximal or mid colon. In contrast, 29% of the animals in the
control group developed carcinoma in one or more regions of the colon.
VSL#3-treated animals had significantly less damage than the vehicle
treated-controls in all areas of the colon, and this correlated with decreased
richness and diversity of the mucosally adherent microbiota. Treatment with the
probiotic increased the antiangiogenic factor angiostatin, VDR expression, and
alkaline sphingomyelinase. We concluded that pretreatment with the probiotic
VSL#3 can attenuate various inflammatory-associated parameters, delaying
transition to dysplasia and cancer, thus offering its potential therapeutic use
in patients with long-standing colitis.

Despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer
(CRC), the composition of gut microbiota in CRC patients has not been adequately 
described. In this study, fecal bacterial diversity in CRC patients (n=46) and
healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the V3 region of
the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Both principal component analysis and UniFrac
analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. Forty-eight
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by redundancy analysis as key 
variables significantly associated with the structural difference. One OTU
closely related to Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of CRC
patients, whereas three OTUs related to Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides
uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. A total of 11 OTUs
belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella,
Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut 
microbiota of CRC patients, and 5 OTUs belonging to the genus Roseburia and other
butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae were less abundant.
Real-time quantitative PCR further validated the significant reduction of
butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of CRC patients by measuring
the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme A CoA transferase genes (Mann-Whitney test, 
P<0.01). Reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens 
may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in CRC patients.

The gut microbiota is a remarkable asset for human health. As a key element in
the development and prevention of specific diseases, its study has yielded a new 
field of promising biotherapeutics. This review provides comprehensive and
updated knowledge of the human gut microbiota, its implications in health and
disease, and the potentials and limitations of its modification by currently
available biotherapeutics to treat, prevent and/or restore human health, and
future directions. Homeostasis of the gut microbiota maintains various functions 
which are vital to the maintenance of human health. Disruption of the intestinal 
ecosystem equilibrium (gut dysbiosis) is associated with a plethora of human
diseases, including autoimmune and allergic diseases, colorectal cancer,
metabolic diseases, and bacterial infections. Relevant underlying mechanisms by
which specific intestinal bacteria populations might trigger the development of
disease in susceptible hosts are being explored across the globe. Beneficial
modulation of the gut microbiota using biotherapeutics, such as prebiotics,
probiotics, and antibiotics, may favor health-promoting populations of bacteria
and can be exploited in development of biotherapeutics. Other technologies, such 
as development of human gut models, bacterial screening, and delivery
formulations eg, microencapsulated probiotics, may contribute significantly in
the near future. Therefore, the human gut microbiota is a legitimate therapeutic 
target to treat and/or prevent various diseases. Development of a clear
understanding of the technologies needed to exploit the gut microbiota is
urgently required.

Germinated barley foodstuff contains prebiotics which are reported to have
anti-cancerous effects in colorectal cancer model, but the detailed mechanism
remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that the role of microbiota was strongly
related to the regulation of incidence and progression of colorectal cancer. The 
aim of this study was to examine the anti-neoplastic mechanism by prebiotics.
Azoxymethane treated F344 rats were used as the sporadic cancerous model. After
azoxymethane injection, either a control or germinated barley foodstuff diet was 
administered to the rats for another 5 weeks, and the number of abberant crypt
foci, toll like receptor 4, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog,
adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene and cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA
expression of colonic mucosa and cecal short chain fatty acids were examined. The
germinated barley food stuff significantly attenuated the number of abberant
crypt focis and the expression of toll like receptor 4 and cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA,
compared to the control group. In addition, the cecal butyrate production in the 
germinated barley foodstuff group was significantly higher than that in the
control. In conclusion, this prebiotic treatment for colorectal cancer may be
useful without causing the adverse effects seen in either anti-cancer drugs or
anti-inflammatory drugs.

Multiple factors drive the progression from healthy mucosa towards sporadic
colorectal carcinomas and accumulating evidence associates intestinal bacteria
with disease initiation and progression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
provide a first high-resolution map of colonic dysbiosis that is associated with 
human colorectal cancer (CRC). To this purpose, the microbiomes colonizing colon 
tumor tissue and adjacent non-malignant mucosa were compared by deep rRNA
sequencing. The results revealed striking differences in microbial colonization
patterns between these two sites. Although inter-individual colonization in CRC
patients was variable, tumors consistently formed a niche for Coriobacteria and
other proposed probiotic bacterial species, while potentially pathogenic
Enterobacteria were underrepresented in tumor tissue. As the intestinal
microbiota is generally stable during adult life, these findings suggest that
CRC-associated physiological and metabolic changes recruit tumor-foraging
commensal-like bacteria. These microbes thus have an apparent competitive
advantage in the tumor microenvironment and thereby seem to replace pathogenic
bacteria that may be implicated in CRC etiology. This first glimpse of the CRC
microbiome provides an important step towards full understanding of the dynamic
interplay between intestinal microbial ecology and sporadic CRC, which may
provide important leads towards novel microbiome-related diagnostic tools and
therapeutic interventions.

Monitoring intestinal microbiota profile: a promising method for the ultraearly
detection of colorectal cancer.

Zhang MM(1), Cheng JQ, Xia L, Lu YR, Wu XT.

University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China.

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and is very hard to be
detected at an ultraearly stage because of lack of valuable predicating methods
that often lead to treatment failure. Intestinal microbiota has long been
considered to implicate in colorectal cancer pathology; and many recent reports
point out a close linkage between the intestinal bacteria and the genesis of the 
tumor. Present studies indicate that the structure and characteristics of the
intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in colorectal cancer,
precancerous lesion, and high risk population compared with healthy controls and 
low risk population. Based on the current studies and theories, we postulate
monitoring the intestinal bacterial profile by the molecular methods that could
fulfill the ultraearly prediction about the degree of the risk developing into
colorectal cancer. Further population-based epidemiological study is useful to
reveal the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in ultraearly colorectal 
cancer, which might provide some novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies
for the colorectal cancer.

The composition of the human intestinal microbiota is linked to health status.
The aim was to analyze the microbiota of normal and colon cancer patients in
order to establish cancer-related dysbiosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stool bacterial
DNA was extracted prior to colonoscopy from 179 patients: 60 with colorectal
cancer, and 119 with normal colonoscopy. Bacterial genes obtained by
pyrosequencing of 12 stool samples (6 Normal and 6 Cancer) were subjected to a
validated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) test. The dominant and subdominant
bacterial population (C. leptum, C. coccoides, Bacteroides/Prevotella,
Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc/Pediococcus groups, Bifidobacterium genus, and E. coli,
and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species) were quantified in all individuals
using qPCR and specific IL17 producer cells in the intestinal mucosa were
characterized using immunohistochemistry.
FINDINGS: Pyrosequencing (Minimal sequence 200 nucleotide reads) revealed 80% of 
all sequences could be assigned to a total of 819 taxa based on default parameter
of Classifier software. The phylogenetic core in Cancer individuals was different
from that in Normal individuals according to the PCA analysis, with trends
towards differences in the dominant and subdominant families of bacteria.
Consequently, All-bacteria [log(10) (bacteria/g of stool)] in Normal, and Cancer 
individuals were similar [11.88±0.35, and 11.80±0.56, respectively, (P = 0.16)], 
according to qPCR values whereas among all dominant and subdominant species only 
those of Bacteroides/Prevotella were higher (All bacteria-specific bacterium;
P = 0.009) in Cancer (-1.04±0.55) than in Normal (-1.40±0.83) individuals. IL17
immunoreactive cells were significantly expressed more in the normal mucosa of
cancer patients than in those with normal colonoscopy.
CONCLUSION: This is the first large series to demonstrate a composition change in
the microbiota of colon cancer patients with possible impact on mucosal immune
response. These data open new filed for mass screening and pathophysiology
investigations.

Dietary resistant and butyrylated starches have different effects on the faecal
bacterial flora of azoxymethane-treated rats.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary fibre lowers the risk of
colorectal cancer, which may be due to increased butyrate production from colonic
fermentation of a type of fibre, resistant starch (RS). The present study
investigated the effects of dietary RS and butyrylated RS on the faecal
microbiota of rats treated with azoxymethane. A total of four groups of nine rats
were fed diets containing either standard maize starch (low-amylose maize starch 
(LAMS), low RS), LAMS with 3 % tributyrin (LAMST), cooked 10 % high-amylose maize
starch (HAMS, high RS) or cooked 10 % butyrylated HAMS (HAMSB). Faecal samples
were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 
16S rRNA gene fragments. Multivariate analysis demonstrated no differences
between faecal microbiota before treatment but revealed differences in DGGE
patterns between diet groups, with the exception of the two low-RS groups (LAMS
and LAMST). Subsequent analysis identified eleven DGGE bands contributing
significantly to the differentiation between diets. These phylotypes belonged to 
Clostridiales (five), Lactobacillus (one) and Bacteroidetes (five) lineages. Rats
fed HAMS had increased concentration of propionate in their distal colonic
digesta and developed faecal populations containing Ruminococcus bromii-like
bacteria. HAMSB increased propionate and butyrate concentrations in distal
colonic digesta and was associated with the appearance of two
non-butyrate-producing bacteria, Lactobacillus gasseri and Parabacteroides
distasonis. In conclusion, supplementation with specific dietary RS leads to
changes in faecal microbiota profiles that may be associated with improved bowel 
health.

BACKGROUND: Infection following abdominal operation remains a major factor
affecting the morbidity of patients after surgery.
AIM: To determine the effects of perioperative administration of probiotics on
the gut barrier function and the surgical outcome in patients undergoing elective
colorectal surgery.
METHODS: One hundred patients with colorectal carcinoma were randomly divided
into the control group (n = 50) and the probiotics group (n = 50). The probiotics
were given orally for 6 days preoperatively and 10 days post-operatively.
Outcomes were measured by bacterial translocation, gut permeability, the effect
on the faecal microbiota, and the clinical outcomes such as infectious-related
complications and gut defecation function.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, probiotics group had increased
transepithelial resistance (P < 0.05), reduced transmucosal permeation of
horseradish peroxidase and lactulose/mannitol ratio, reduced bacterial
translocation (P < 0.05), decreased ileal-bile acid binding protein (P < 0.05)
and positive rate of blood bacterial DNA (P < 0.05) and an enhanced mucosal tight
junction protein expression. They had decreased blood enteropathogenic bacteria
and increased faecal bacterial variety. The post-operative recovery of
peristalsis, incidence of diarrhoea, and infectious-related complications were
also improved.
CONCLUSION: Probiotics can improve the integrity of gut mucosal barrier by
benefiting the faecal microbiota, and decreasing infectious complications in
patients with colorectal cancer undergoing colorectomy.

The human large bowel is colonized by complex and diverse bacterial communities. 
However, the relationship between commensal bowel bacteria and adenomas
(colorectal cancer precursors) is unclear. This study aimed to characterize
adherent bacteria in normal colon and evaluate differences in community
composition associated with colorectal adenomas. We evaluated adherent bacteria
in normal colonic mucosa of 21 adenoma and 23 non-adenoma subjects enrolled in a 
cross sectional study. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, clone
sequencing and fluorescent in-situ hybridization analysis of the 16S rRNA genes
were used to characterize adherent bacteria. A total of 335 clones were sequenced
and processed for phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis. Differences in bacterial
composition between cases and controls were evaluated by UniFrac and analysis of 
similarity matrix. Overall, Firmicutes (62%), Bacteroidetes (26%) and
Proteobacteria (11%) were the most dominant phyla. The bacterial composition
differed significantly between cases and controls (UniFrac p < 0.001). We
observed significantly higher abundance of Proteobacteria (p < 0.05) and lower
abundance of Bacteroidetes (p < 0.05) in cases compared to controls. At the genus
level, case subjects showed increased abundance of Dorea spp. (p < 0.005),
Faecalibacterium spp. (p < 0.05) and lower proportions of Bacteroides spp. (p <
0.03) and Coprococcus spp. (p < 0.05) than controls. Cases had higher bacterial
diversity and richness than controls. These findings reveal that alterations in
bacterial community composition associated with adenomas may contribute to the
etiology of colorectal cancer. Extension of these findings could lead to
strategies to manipulate the microbiota to prevent colorectal adenomas and cancer
as well as to identify individuals at high risk.

AIM: To investigate whether probiotic bacteria, given perioperatively, might
adhere to the colonic mucosa, reduce concentration of pathogens in stools, and
modulate the local immune function.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was carried out in 31 subjects
undergoing elective colorectal resection for cancer. Patients were allocated to
receive either a placebo (group A, n = 10), or a dose of 10(7) of a mixture of
Bifidobacterium longum (BB536) and Lactobacillus johnsonii (La1) (group B, n =
11), or the same mixture at a concentration of 10(9) (group C, n = 10).
Probiotics, or a placebo, were given orally 2 doses/d for 3 d before operation.
The same treatment continued postoperatively from day two to day four. Stools
were collected before treatment, during surgery (day 0) and 5 d after operation. 
During the operation, colonic mucosa samples were harvested to evaluate bacterial
adherence and to assess the phenotype of dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocyte
subsets by surface antigen expression (flow cytometry). The presence of BB536 and
La1 was evaluated by the random amplified polymorphism DNA method with specific
polymerase chain reaction probes.
RESULTS: The three groups were balanced for baseline and surgical parameters.
BB536 was never found at any time-points studied. At day 0, La1 was present in
6/10 (60%) patients in either stools or by biopsy in group C, in 3/11 (27.2%) in 
group B, and none in the placebo group (P = 0.02, C vs A). There was a linear
correlation between dose given and number of adherent La1 (P = 0.01). The rate of
mucosal colonization by enterobacteriacae was 30% (3/10) in C, 81.8% (9/11) in B 
and 70% (7/10) in A (P = 0.03, C vs B). The Enterobacteriacae count in stools was
2.4 (log10 scale) in C, 4.6 in B, and 4.5 in A (P = 0.07, C vs A and B). The same
trend was observed for colonizing enterococci. La1 was not found at day +5. We
observed greater expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, and naive and memory lymphocyte
subsets in group C than in group A with a dose response trend (C > B > A).
Treatment did not affect DC phenotype or activation, but after ex vivo
stimulation with lipopolysaccharides, groups C and B had a lower proliferation
rate compared to group A (P = 0.04). Moreover, dendritic phenotypes CD83-123,
CD83-HLADR, and CD83-11c (markers of activation) were significantly less
expressed in patients colonized with La1 (P = 0.03 vs not colonized).
CONCLUSION: La1, but not BB536, adheres to the colonic mucosa, and affects
intestinal microbiota by reducing the concentration of pathogens and modulates
local immunity.

composition and fecal water genotoxicity: an observational study in African
American and Caucasian American volunteers.

BACKGROUND: African Americans (AA) suffer from an increased incidence and
mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). Environmental exposures including dietary
habits likely contribute to a high burden of CRC, however, data on the dietary
habits of AA is sparse. Diet might change the composition and the activities of
the intestinal microbiota, in turn affecting fecal genotoxicity/mutagenicity that
is thought to be associated with carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We assessed dietary habits by food frequency questionnaire and by food
records in 52 AA and 46 CA residents of the Eastern Shore of MD. Fecal microbiota
composition was determined using 16S rRNA based methods and fecal genotoxicity
measured using the Comet assay.
RESULTS: AA reported an increased intake of heterocyclic amines and a decreased
dietary intake of vitamins including vitamin D (p<0.05) that correlated with
differences in fecal microbiota composition but not fecal genotoxicity. Intake of
dietary fiber, calcium, total fat and heterocyclic amines correlated with
differences in microbiota composition. Total bacterial counts/g of stool and raw 
counts of Bacteroides were increased in AA. In contrast to a previous study, BMI 
was not associated with proportions of Bacteroides.
CONCLUSION: Dietary habits of African Americans, including increased HCA intake
and decreased vitamin D intake might at least partially contribute to CRC through
modifications of gut microbiota composition that result in changes of the
intestinal milieu.

It is well established that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role in the
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) collectively
referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Epidemiological studies have
provided strong evidence that IBD patients bear increased risk for the
development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the impact of the microbiota on 
the development of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) remains largely unknown. In
this study, we established a new model of CAC using azoxymethane (AOM)-exposed,
conventionalized-Il10(-/-) mice and have explored the contribution of the host
intestinal microbiota and MyD88 signaling to the development of CAC. We show that
8/13 (62%) of AOM-Il10(-/-) mice developed colon tumors compared to only 3/15
(20%) of AOM- wild-type (WT) mice. Conventionalized AOM-Il10(-/-) mice developed 
spontaneous colitis and colorectal carcinomas while AOM-WT mice were colitis-free
and developed only rare adenomas. Importantly, tumor multiplicity directly
correlated with the presence of colitis. Il10(-/-) mice mono-associated with the 
mildly colitogenic bacterium Bacteroides vulgatus displayed significantly reduced
colitis and colorectal tumor multiplicity compared to Il10(-/-) mice. Germ-free
AOM-treated Il10(-/-) mice showed normal colon histology and were devoid of
tumors. Il10(-/-); Myd88(-/-) mice treated with AOM displayed reduced expression 
of Il12p40 and Tnfalpha mRNA and showed no signs of tumor development. We present
the first direct demonstration that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota
alters the development of CAC. The TLR/MyD88 pathway is essential for
microbiota-induced development of CAC. Unlike findings obtained using the AOM/DSS
model, we demonstrate that the severity of chronic colitis directly correlates to
colorectal tumor development and that bacterial-induced inflammation drives
progression from adenoma to invasive carcinoma.

The normal microbiota and man form a superorganism, in which only 10% are human
cells. The skin and mucous membranes support 10(14) living microbes, mainly at
the end of the gastrointestinal tract, forming a 1.5-kg cell mass ecosystem
mainly consisting of bacteria. Investigations of the intestinal microbiota have
yielded an estimated biodiversity of 1200-16000 bacterial phylotypes. They are
known to affect physiology, development of immune defense, colonization
resistance and nutrition. Changes in microbial population can be associated with 
inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, obesity
and type 2 diabetes.

Intestinal microbiota are considered to play an important role both in colorectal
tumor development and in the modulation of mucosal immunity. Studies on animals
reared in germ-free (GF, without intestinal microbiota) versus conventional (CV, 
with regular microbiota colonization of the bowel) conditions can aid in
clarifying the influence of bacteria on carcinogenesis and the anticancer immune 
response. The capability of the intestinal environment to modulate anticancer
immunity not only at the mucosal but also at the systemic level is still an open 
question. In our study we found that, following the same protocol of colorectal
cancer induction, GF rats developed less and smaller tumors than CV rats. The GF 
rats that did not develop cancer also presented a better anticancer immune
response with an increase in NK, NKT, CTL, B cells and cytotoxicity in peripheral
blood. We hypothesize that the lower antigenic challenge and the absence of the
'physiological inflammation', caused by the commensal microbiota in the gut of CV
rats, may enhance the capability of the GF rats to develop more efficacious
anticancer immune responses. The different levels of tolerance/regulatory
mechanisms in GF versus the CV animals may modulate the anticancer response not
only at the mucosal but also at the systemic immunity level.

A role for the intestinal microbiota is routinely cited as a potential
aetiological factor in colorectal cancer initiation and progression. As the
majority of bacteria in the gut are refractory to culture we investigated this
ecosystem in subjects with colorectal cancer and with adenomatous polyposis who
are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer, using culture-independent
methods. Twenty colorectal cancer and 20 polypectomized volunteers were chosen
for this analysis. An exploration of the diversity and temporal stability of the 
dominant bacteria and several bacterial subgroups was undertaken using 16S rRNA
gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and ribosomal intergenic spacer
analysis (RISA). Metabonomic analysis of the distal gut microbiota's environment 
was also undertaken. A significantly reduced temporal stability and increased
diversity for the microbiota of subjects with colorectal cancer and polyposis was
evident. A significantly increased diversity of the Clostridium leptum and C.
coccoides subgroups was also noted for both disease groups. A clear division in
the metabonome was observed for the colorectal cancer and polypectomized subjects
compared with control volunteers. The intestinal microbiota and their metabolites
are significantly altered in both colorectal cancer and polypectomized subjects
compared with controls.

AIM: To characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in
patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis.
METHODS: A sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a
total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with
diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for
their condition. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the resected mucosal samples
and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and
quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Bifidobacteria were found in 100% of the samples from patients with
diverticulitis or IBD and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. The species B.
longum and B. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by B. animalis, B.
catenulatum and B. adolescentis. B. breve, B. dentium and B. angulatum were not
detected in any sample. A significantly higher occurrence of B. longum was
observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or IBD
(100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained for B.
animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, P < 0.05), while B. adolescentis was only found in the
mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). At the quantitative
level, patients with colon cancer or IBD showed lower counts of total
Bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, P < 0.05) 
and of the species B. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, P < 0.05) than those with
diverticulitis.
CONCLUSION: Aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different 
intestinal diseases. This may indicate a role of the microbiota in the
pathogenesis of these diseases.

Evidence that hydrogen sulfide is a genotoxic agent.

Attene-Ramos MS(1), Wagner ED, Plewa MJ, Gaskins HR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Animal Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by commensal sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are
often members of normal colonic microbiota, represents an environmental insult to
the intestinal epithelium potentially contributing to chronic intestinal
disorders that are dependent on gene-environment interactions. For example,
epidemiologic studies reveal either persistent sulfate-reducing bacteria
colonization or H2S in the gut or feces of patients suffering from ulcerative
colitis and colorectal cancer. However, a mechanistic model that explains the
connection between H2S and ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer development
has not been completely formulated. In this study, we examined the chronic
cytotoxicity of sulfide using a microplate assay and genotoxicity using the
single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE; comet assay) in Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) and HT29-Cl.16E cells. Sulfide showed chronic cytotoxicity in CHO cells
with a %C1/2 of 368.57 micromol/L. Sulfide was not genotoxic in the standard SCGE
assay. However, in a modified SCGE assay in which DNA repair was inhibited, a
marked genotoxic effect was observed. A sulfide concentration as low as 250
micromol/L (similar to that found in human colon) caused significant genomic DNA 
damage. The HT29-Cl.16E colonocyte cell line also exhibited increased genomic DNA
damage as a function of Na2S concentration when DNA repair was inhibited,
although these cells were less sensitive to sulfide than CHO cells. These data
indicate that given a predisposing genetic background that compromises DNA
repair, H2S may lead to genomic instability or the cumulative mutations found in 
adenomatous polyps leading to colorectal cancer.

Changes in cecal microbial metabolism of rats induced by individual and a mixture
of drinking water disinfection by-products.

Disinfection of drinking water has been one of the greatest public health
successes. Numerous halogenated disinfection by-products (DBPs) occur and chronic
ingestion has been associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer in
human populations. Because the intestinal microbiota can bioactivate xenobiotics,
studies have been performed to examine the effects of individual DBPs on
intestinal microbial metabolism. No studies have been conducted on a defined
mixture of DBPs to determine if there is an enhancement of response to a mixture.
Ten-week-old male Long-Evans rats were treated in their drinking water for 17
weeks with 0.4 g/l potassium bromate, 1.8 g/l chloroform, 0.7 g/l
bromodichloromethane (BDCM), 0.07 g/l
3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX), or a mixture of the
four chemicals or distilled water. Cecal nitroreductase (NR), azoreductase (AR), 
dechlorinase (DC), beta-glucuronidase (GLR), beta-galactosidase (GAL), and
beta-glucosidase (GLU) were assayed. No change in GLU or GLR activity was
detected after treatment. BDCM treatment reduced DC and GAL activities and
elevated NR and AR activity. GAL, AR, and NR activities were significantly
different after treatment with bromate, chloroform, BDCM, and MX, but not the
mixture. DC activity after chloroform-, MX-, or BDCM-treatment was significantly 
below control levels. The present study shows that changes in intestinal
microbial metabolism do occur after treatment with individual and a mixture of
DBPs but the changes were not additive in the mixture group.

CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T lymphocytes inhibit microbially induced colon cancer in
Rag2-deficient mice.

Inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
increase the risk of colorectal cancer in humans. It has been recently shown in
humans and animal models that intestinal microbiota and host immunity are
integral in the progression of large bowel diseases. Lymphocytes are widely
believed to prevent bacterially induced inflammation in the bowel, and
lymphocytes are also critical in protecting against primary tumors of intestinal 
epithelia in mice. Taken together, this raises the possibility that lymphocytes
may inhibit colon carcinogenesis by reducing bacterially driven inflammation. To 
examine the role of bacteria, lymphocytes, and inflammatory bowel disease in the 
development of colon cancer, 129/SvEv Rag-2-deficient and congenic wild-type mice
were orally inoculated with a widespread enteric mouse bacterial pathogen,
Helicobacter hepaticus, or sham-dosed with media only. H. hepaticus-infected
Rag2-/-, but not sham-dosed Rag2-/- mice, rapidly developed colitis and large
bowel carcinoma. This demonstrated a link between microbially driven inflammation
and cancer in the lower bowel and suggested that innate immune dysregulation may 
have an important role in inflammatory bowel disease and progression to cancer.
H. hepaticus-infected wild-type mice did not develop inflammation or carcinoma
showing that lymphocytes were required to prevent bacterially induced cancer at
this site. Adoptive transfer with CD4+ CD45RBlo CD25+ regulatory T cells into
Rag-deficient hosts significantly inhibited H. hepaticus-induced inflammation and
development of cancer. These results suggested that the ability of CD4+ T cells
to protect against intestinal cancer was correlated with their ability to reduce 
bacterially induced inflammatory bowel disease. Further, regulatory T cells may
act directly on the innate immune system to reduce or prevent disease. These
roles for T cells in protection against colon carcinoma may have implications for
new modes of prevention and treatment of cancer in humans.
