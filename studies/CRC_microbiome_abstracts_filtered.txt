In this study Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze and compare
human microbiota from three different compartments, i.e., saliva, feces, and
cancer tissue (CT), of a selected cohort of 10 Italian patients with colorectal
cancer (CRC) vs. 10 healthy controls (saliva and feces). Furthermore, the
Fusobacterium nucleatum abundance in the same body site was investigated through 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to assess the association
with CRC. Differences in bacterial composition, F. nucleatum abundance in healthy
controls vs. CRC patients, and the association of F. nucleatum with clinical
parameters were observed. Taxonomic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene, revealed the
presence of three main bacterial phyla, which includes about 80% of reads:
Firmicutes (39.18%), Bacteroidetes (30.36%), and Proteobacteria (10.65%). The
results highlighted the presence of different bacterial compositions; in
particular, the fecal samples of CRC patients seemed to be enriched with
Bacteroidetes, whereas in the fecal samples of healthy controls Firmicutes were
one of the major phyla detected though these differences were not statistically
significant. The CT samples showed the highest alpha diversity values. These
results emphasize a different taxonomic composition of feces from CRC compared to
healthy controls. Despite the low number of samples included in the study, these 
results suggest the importance of microbiota in the CRC progression and could
pave the way to the development of therapeutic interventions and novel
microbial-related diagnostic tools in CRC patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common cancer worldwide, with a
growing incidence among young adults. Multiple studies have presented
associations between the gut microbiome and CRC, suggesting a link with cancer
risk. Although CRC microbiome studies continue to profile larger patient cohorts 
with increasingly economical and rapid DNA sequencing platforms, few common
associations with CRC have been identified, in part due to limitations in
taxonomic resolution and differences in analysis methodologies. Complementing
these taxonomic studies is the newly recognized phenomenon that bacterial
organization into biofilm structures in the mucus layer of the gut is a
consistent feature of right-sided (proximal), but not left-sided (distal)
colorectal cancer. In the present study, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon
sequencing and biofilm quantification in a new cohort of patients from Malaysia, 
followed by a meta-analysis of eleven additional publicly available data sets on 
stool and tissue-based CRC microbiota using Resphera Insight, a high-resolution
analytical tool for species-level characterization. Results from the Malaysian
cohort and the expanded meta-analysis confirm that CRC tissues are enriched for
invasive biofilms (particularly on right-sided tumors), a symbiont with capacity 
for tumorigenesis (Bacteroides fragilis), and oral pathogens including
Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Peptostreptococcus stomatis.
Considered in aggregate, species from the Human Oral Microbiome Database are
highly enriched in CRC. Although no detected microbial feature was universally
present, their substantial overlap and combined prevalence supports a role for
the gut microbiota in a significant percentage (>80%) of CRC cases.

Colorectal cancers comprise a complex mixture of malignant cells, nontransformed 
cells, and microorganisms. Fusobacterium nucleatum is among the most prevalent
bacterial species in colorectal cancer tissues. Here we show that colonization of
human colorectal cancers with Fusobacterium and its associated
microbiome-including Bacteroides, Selenomonas, and Prevotella species-is
maintained in distal metastases, demonstrating microbiome stability between
paired primary and metastatic tumors. In situ hybridization analysis revealed
that Fusobacterium is predominantly associated with cancer cells in the
metastatic lesions. Mouse xenografts of human primary colorectal adenocarcinomas 
were found to retain viable Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome through
successive passages. Treatment of mice bearing a colon cancer xenograft with the 
antibiotic metronidazole reduced Fusobacterium load, cancer cell proliferation,
and overall tumor growth. These observations argue for further investigation of
antimicrobial interventions as a potential treatment for patients with
Fusobacterium-associated colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a worldwide health problem. Despite growing
evidence that members of the gut microbiota can drive tumorigenesis, little is
known about what happens to it after treatment for an adenoma or carcinoma. This 
study tested the hypothesis that treatment for adenoma or carcinoma alters the
abundance of bacterial populations associated with disease to those associated
with a normal colon. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes
in the feces of 67 individuals before and after treatment for adenoma (N = 22),
advanced adenoma (N = 19), and carcinoma (N = 26).
RESULTS: There were small changes to the bacterial community associated with
adenoma or advanced adenoma and large changes associated with carcinoma. The
communities from patients with carcinomas changed significantly more than those
with adenoma following treatment (P value < 0.001). Although treatment was
associated with intrapersonal changes, the change in the abundance of individual 
OTUs in response to treatment was not consistent within diagnosis groups (P value
> 0.05). Because the distribution of OTUs across patients and diagnosis groups
was irregular, we used the random forest machine learning algorithm to identify
groups of OTUs that could be used to classify pre and post-treatment samples for 
each of the diagnosis groups. Although the adenoma and carcinoma models could
reliably differentiate between the pre- and post-treatment samples (P value <
0.001), the advanced-adenoma model could not (P value = 0.61). Furthermore, there
was little overlap between the OTUs that were indicative of each treatment. To
determine whether individuals who underwent treatment were more likely to have
OTUs associated with normal colons we used a larger cohort that contained
individuals with normal colons and those with adenomas, advanced adenomas, and
carcinomas. We again built random forest models and measured the change in the
positive probability of having one of the three diagnoses to assess whether the
post-treatment samples received the same classification as the pre-treatment
samples. Samples from patients who had carcinomas changed toward a microbial
milieu that resembles the normal colon after treatment (P value < 0.001).
Finally, we were unable to detect any significant differences in the microbiota
of individuals treated with surgery alone and those treated with chemotherapy or 
chemotherapy and radiation (P value > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: By better understanding the response of the microbiota to treatment 
for adenomas and carcinomas, it is likely that biomarkers will eventually be
validated that can be used to quantify the risk of recurrence and the likelihood 
of survival. Although it was difficult to identify significant differences
between pre- and post-treatment samples from patients with adenoma and advanced
adenoma, this was not the case for carcinomas. Not only were there large changes 
in pre- versus post-treatment samples for those with carcinoma, but also these
changes were toward a more normal microbiota.

Increasing evidence suggests a role of the gut microbiota in colorectal
carcinogenesis (CRC). To detect bacterial markers of colorectal cancer in African
Americans a metabolomic analysis was performed on fecal water extracts. DNA from 
stool samples of adenoma and healthy subjects and from colon cancer and matched
normal tissues was analyzed to determine the microbiota composition (using 16S
rDNA) and genomic content (metagenomics). Metagenomic functions with
discriminative power between healthy and neoplastic specimens were established.
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (q-PCR) using primers and probes specific 
to Streptococcus sp. VT_162 were used to validate this bacterium association with
neoplastic transformation in stool samples from two independent cohorts of
African Americans and Chinese patients with colorectal lesions. The metabolomic
analysis of adenomas revealed low amino acids content. The microbiota in both
cancer vs. normal tissues and adenoma vs. normal stool samples were different at 
the 16S rRNA gene level. Cross-mapping of metagenomic data led to 9 markers with 
significant discriminative power between normal and diseased specimens. These
markers identified with Streptococcus sp. VT_162. Q-PCR data showed a
statistically significant presence of this bacterium in advanced adenoma and
cancer samples in an independent cohort of CRC patients. We defined metagenomic
functions from Streptococcus sp. VT_162 with discriminative power among cancers
vs. matched normal and adenomas vs. healthy subjects' stools. Streptococcus sp.
VT_162 specific 16S rDNA was validated in an independent cohort. These findings
might facilitate non-invasive screening for colorectal cancer.

It is well appreciated that microbial metabolism of drugs can influence treatment
efficacy. Microbial β-glucuronidases in the gut can reactivate the excreted,
inactive metabolite of irinotecan, a first-line chemotherapeutic for metastatic
colorectal cancer. Reactivation causes adverse drug responses, including severe
diarrhea. However, a direct connection between irinotecan metabolism and the
composition of an individual's gut microbiota has not previously been made. Here,
we report quantitative evidence of inter-individual variability in microbiome
metabolism of the inactive metabolite of irinotecan to its active form. We
identify a high turnover microbiota metabotype with potentially elevated risk for
irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses. We link the high turnover metabotype
to unreported microbial β-glucuronidases; inhibiting these enzymes may decrease
irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses in targeted subsets of patients. In
total, this study reveals metagenomic mining of the microbiome, combined with
metabolomics, as a non-invasive approach to develop biomarkers for colorectal
cancer treatment outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Microbiota alterations are linked with colorectal cancer
(CRC) and notably higher abundance of putative oral bacteria on colonic tumours. 
However, it is not known if colonic mucosa-associated taxa are indeed orally
derived, if such cases are a distinct subset of patients or if the oral
microbiome is generally suitable for screening for CRC.
METHODS: We profiled the microbiota in oral swabs, colonic mucosae and stool from
individuals with CRC (99 subjects), colorectal polyps (32) or controls (103).
RESULTS: Several oral taxa were differentially abundant in CRC compared with
controls, for example, Streptococcus and Prevotellas pp. A classification model
of oral swab microbiota distinguished individuals with CRC or polyps from
controls (sensitivity: 53% (CRC)/67% (polyps); specificity: 96%). Combining the
data from faecal microbiota and oral swab microbiota increased the sensitivity of
this model to 76% (CRC)/88% (polyps). We detected similar bacterial networks in
colonic microbiota and oral microbiota datasets comprising putative oral biofilm 
forming bacteria. While these taxa were more abundant in CRC, core networks
between pathogenic, CRC-associated oral bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus,
Parvimonas and Fusobacterium were also detected in healthy controls. High
abundance of Lachnospiraceae was negatively associated with the colonisation of
colonic tissue with oral-like bacterial networks suggesting a protective role for
certain microbiota types against CRC, possibly by conferring colonisation
resistance to CRC-associated oral taxa and possibly mediated through habitual
diet.
CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of CRC may relate to microbiota types that either
predispose or provide resistance to the disease, and profiling the oral
microbiome may offer an alternative screen for detecting CRC.

Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancer types
worldwide. The role of the intestinal microbiota in CRC, however, is not well
established. In particular, the co-variation between age, tumor progression and
microbiota remains largely unknown. Objective and design: We therefore used a
recently developed A/J Min/+ mouse model resembling human CRC to investigate how 
microbial composition in cecum correlates with tumor progression, butyrate and
age. Results: We found that the association between the gut microbiota and tumor 
load was stronger, by far, than the association with both butyrate and age. The
strongest direct tumor association was found for mucosal bacteria, with nearly
60% of the significantly correlating operational taxonomic units being correlated
with CRC tumor load alone. Conclusion: We favor a systemic association between
tumor load and microbiota, since the correlations are associated with tumor load 
in gut segments other than the cecum (both small and large intestine).

Noninvasive photoacoustic identification and imaging of gut microbes.

Huang X, Shi Y, Liu Y, Xu H, Liu Y, Xiao C, Ren J, Nie L.

Homeostasis of the gut microbiota is indispensable for various physiological
functions. Its composition and activity co-develop with the host, and especially 
associate with human colorectal cancer. However, current composition
identification methods are complicated and not timely without spatial
distribution information. In this Letter, we explored the photoacoustic imaging
(PAI) technique to characterize the composition and quantify the proportions of
the gut microbes after optical probe labeling. Our experimental results
demonstrated that PAI has the potential to identify different gut bacterial
species on the spot.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most treatable cancers, with a 5-year
survival rate of ~64%, yet over 50,000 deaths occur yearly in the United States. 
In 15% of cases, deficiency in mismatch repair leads to null mutations in
transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) type II receptor, yet genotype alone is not 
responsible for tumorigenesis. Previous work in mice shows that disruptions in
TGF-β signaling combined with Helicobacter hepaticus cause tumorigenesis,
indicating a synergistic effect between genotype and microbial environment. Here,
we examine functional shifts in the gut microbiome in CRC using integrated -omics
approaches to untangle the role of host genotype, inflammation, and microbial
ecology. We profile the gut microbiome of 40 mice with/without deficiency in
TGF-β signaling from a Smad3 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog-3) knockout
and with/without inoculation with H. hepaticus. Clear functional differences in
the microbiome tied to specific bacterial species emerge from four pathways
related to human colon cancer: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, polyamine
synthesis, butyrate metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
Specifically, an increase in Mucispirillum schaedleri drives LPS production,
which is associated with an inflammatory response. We observe a commensurate
decrease in butyrate production from Lachnospiraceae bacterium A4, which could
promote tumor formation. H. hepaticus causes an increase in OXPHOS that may
increase DNA-damaging free radicals. Finally, multiple bacterial species increase
polyamines that are associated with colon cancer, implicating not just diet but
also the microbiome in polyamine levels. These insights into cross talk between
the microbiome, host genotype, and inflammation could promote the development of 
diagnostics and therapies for CRC. IMPORTANCE Most research on the gut microbiome
in colon cancer focuses on taxonomic changes at the genus level using 16S rRNA
gene sequencing. Here, we develop a new methodology to integrate DNA and RNA data
sets to examine functional shifts at the species level that are important to
tumor development. We uncover several metabolic pathways in the microbiome that, 
when perturbed by host genetics and H. hepaticus inoculation, contribute to colon
cancer. The work presented here lays a foundation for improved bioinformatics
methodologies to closely examine the cross talk between specific organisms and
the host, important for the development of diagnostics and pre/probiotic
treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have anticolorectal cancer
(CRC) activity. The intestinal microbiota has been implicated in colorectal
carcinogenesis. Dietary omega-3 PUFAs alter the mouse intestinal microbiome
compatible with antineoplastic activity. Therefore, we investigated the effect of
omega-3 PUFA supplements on the faecal microbiome in middle-aged, healthy
volunteers (n=22).
DESIGN: A randomised, open-label, cross-over trial of 8 weeks' treatment with 4 g
mixed eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid in two formulations (soft-gel
capsules and Smartfish drinks), separated by a 12-week 'washout' period. Faecal
samples were collected at five time-points for microbiome analysis by 16S
ribosomal RNA PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid 
analysis was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Both omega-3 PUFA formulations induced similar changes in RBC fatty acid
content, except that drinks were associated with a larger, and more prolonged,
decrease in omega-6 PUFA arachidonic acid than the capsule intervention (p=0.02).
There were no significant changes in α or β diversity, or phyla composition,
associated with omega-3 PUFA supplementation. However, a reversible increased
abundance of several genera, including Bifidobacterium, Roseburia and
Lactobacillus was observed with one or both omega-3 PUFA interventions.
Microbiome changes did not correlate with RBC omega-3 PUFA incorporation or
development of omega-3 PUFA-induced diarrhoea. There were no treatment order
effects.
CONCLUSION: Omega-3 PUFA supplementation induces a reversible increase in several
short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, independently of the method of
administration. There is no simple relationship between the intestinal microbiome
and systemic omega-3 PUFA exposure.

A significant challenge toward studies of the human microbiota involves
establishing causal links between bacterial metabolites and human health and
disease states. Certain strains of commensal Escherichia coli harbor the 54-kb
clb gene cluster which codes for small molecules named precolibactins and
colibactins. Several studies suggest colibactins are genotoxins and support a
role for clb metabolites in colorectal cancer formation. Significant advances
toward elucidating the structures and biosynthesis of the precolibactins and
colibactins have been made using genetic approaches, but their full structures
remain unknown. In this Perspective we describe recent synthetic efforts that
have leveraged biosynthetic advances and shed light on the mechanism of action of
clb metabolites. These studies indicate that deletion of the colibactin peptidase
ClbP, a modification introduced to promote accumulation of precolibactins, leads 
to the production of non-genotoxic pyridone-based isolates derived from the
diversion of linear biosynthetic intermediates toward alternative cyclization
pathways. Furthermore, these studies suggest the active genotoxins (colibactins) 
are unsaturated imines that are potent DNA damaging agents, thereby confirming an
earlier mechanism of action hypothesis. Although these imines have very recently 
been detected in bacterial extracts, they have to date confounded isolation. As
the power of "meta-omics" approaches to natural products discovery further
advance, we anticipate that chemical synthetic and biosynthetic studies will
become increasingly interdependent.

OBJECTIVE: The colonic microbiota is altered in patients with colorectal cancer
(CRC). We investigated the microbiota composition of patients with colon cancer
compared with controls devoid of neoplastic or inflammatory disease and the
potential to modify the colonic microbiota with probiotics.
DESIGN: Biopsy samples were obtained from the normal mucosa and tumour during
colonoscopy from 15 patients with colon cancer. Subsequent patient-matched
samples were taken at surgery from the tumour and nearby mucosa from the patients
with cancer, eight of whom had received two daily tablets totalling 1.4×1010 CFUs
Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 and 7×109 CFUs Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
Faecal samples were obtained after colonoscopy prior to starting the intervention
and at surgery. In addition, 21 mucosal biopsies from non-cancer controls were
obtained during colonoscopy followed by later faecal samples. The colonic and
faecal microbiota was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
RESULTS: The tumour microbiota was characterised by increased microbial diversity
and enrichment of several taxa including Fusobacterium, Selenomonas and
Peptostreptococcus compared with the control microbiota. Patients with colon
cancer that received probiotics had an increased abundance of butyrate-producing 
bacteria, especially Faecalibacterium and Clostridiales spp in the tumour,
non-tumour mucosa and faecal microbiota. CRC-associated genera such as
Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus tended to be reduced in the faecal
microbiota of patients that received probiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with colon cancer harbour a distinct microbiota signature
in the tumour tissue and nearby mucosa, which was altered with probiotic
intervention. Our results show promise for potential therapeutic benefits in CRC 
by manipulation of the microbiota.

Intestinal microbes are recognized for their role in human disease.
Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) has been implicated in inflammatory
bowel disease and colorectal cancer; however, colonization alone is insufficient 
to cause these illnesses. We hypothesized that homeostasis in healthy carriers is
maintained by colonic mucus, the major constituent of which is the glycoprotein
Muc2. We found that Muc2-deficient mice succumb to lethal disease from ETBF
colonization in a B. fragilis toxin (BFT)-dependent manner. We identify a toxin
regulator, the two-component system RprXY, which suppresses BFT expression
in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of either component was sufficient to
prevent lethal disease in Muc2-deficient mice. Our studies demonstrate that
homeostasis in the context of ETBF colonization is dependent on a dynamic
interaction between intestinal mucus, a bacterial toxin, and a toxin regulatory
system. Regulation of virulence may offer a therapeutic target to maintain
intestinal homeostasis in susceptible patients.

Microbiome-mediated suppression of carcinogenesis may open new avenues for
identification of therapeutic targets and prevention strategies in oncology.
Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) deficiency has been shown to promote
inflammation-associated colorectal cancer by accumulation of CD11b+Gr-1+ immature
myeloid cells, indicating a potential antitumorigenic effect of histamine. Here, 
we demonstrate that administration of hdc+Lactobacillus reuteri in the gut
resulted in luminal hdc gene expression and histamine production in the
intestines of Hdc-/- mice. This histamine-producing probiotic decreased the
number and size of colon tumors and colonic uptake of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose by
positron emission tomography in Hdc-/- mice. Administration of L. reuteri
suppressed keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), Il22, Il6, Tnf, and IL1α gene
expression in the colonic mucosa and reduced the amounts of proinflammatory,
cancer-associated cytokines, keratinocyte chemoattractant, IL-22, and IL-6, in
plasma. Histamine-generating L. reuteri also decreased the relative numbers of
splenic CD11b+Gr-1+ immature myeloid cells. Furthermore, an isogenic
HDC-deficient L. reuteri mutant that was unable to generate histamine did not
suppress carcinogenesis, indicating a significant role of the cometabolite,
histamine, in suppression of chronic intestinal inflammation and colorectal
tumorigenesis. These findings link luminal conversion of amino acids to biogenic 
amines by gut microbes and probiotic-mediated suppression of colorectal
neoplasia.

Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD). In colorectal cancer, the gut microbiota has also been recognized as
potentially involved in aggravating or favoring the tumor development. However,
very little is known on the structure and role of the microbiota in colitis
associated cancer (CAC), an important complication of IBD in human. Here we
analyzed the bacterial and fungal composition of the mucosa associated microbiota
of patients suffering CAC, sporadic cancer (SC) and of healthy subjects (HS) by
barcode sequences analysis on the following cohort: 7 CAC patients, 10 SC
patients and 10 HS using 16S (MiSeq) and ITS2 (pyrosequencing) sequencing, for
bacteria and fungi respectively. Mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in CAC
was significantly different from the ones in SC or in HS, while the fungal showed
no differences. Comparison between mucosa-associated microbiota on the tumor site
or in normal mucosa near the tumor showed very similar patterns. The global
mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in cancer patients was characterized by a 
restriction in biodiversity but no change for the fungal community. Compared to
SC, CAC was characterized by an increase of Enterobacteriacae family and
Sphingomonas genus and a decrease of Fusobacterium and Ruminococcus genus. Our
study confirms the alteration of the mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in
IBD and SC. Although the cohort is limited in number, this is the first evidence 
of the existence of an altered bacterial microbiota in CAC clearly different from
the one in SC patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease and recent advances in subtype
classification have successfully stratified the disease using molecular
profiling. The contribution of bacterial species to CRC development is
increasingly acknowledged, and here, we sought to analyse CRC microbiomes and
relate them to tumour consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), in order to better
understand the relationship between bacterial species and the molecular
mechanisms associated with CRC subtypes. We classified 34 tumours into CRC
subtypes using RNA-sequencing derived gene expression and determined relative
abundances of bacterial taxonomic groups using 16S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding.
16S rRNA analysis showed enrichment of Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and
decreased levels of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in CMS1. A more detailed
analysis of bacterial taxa using non-human RNA-sequencing reads uncovered
distinct bacterial communities associated with each molecular subtype. The most
highly enriched species associated with CMS1 included Fusobacterium hwasookii and
Porphyromonas gingivalis. CMS2 was enriched for Selenomas and Prevotella species,
while CMS3 had few significant associations. Targeted quantitative PCR validated 
these findings and also showed an enrichment of Fusobacterium nucleatum,
Parvimonas micra and Peptostreptococcus stomatis in CMS1. In this study, we have 
successfully associated individual bacterial species to CRC subtypes for the
first time.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the microbiota community
structure, assess differences in intestinal bacterial types, and identify
metagenomic biomarkers for disparate stages of colorectal cancer formation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 160 individuals were recruited: 61 cases with
non-tumor colon were regarded as the normal group, 47 cases with
histology-substantiated colorectal adenomas were regarded as the adenoma group,
and 52 cases with invasive adenocarcinomas were regarded as the cancer group.
Biopsy on the mucosa was performed on each subject. USEARCH was used to process
the sequences data and generate OTUs. Gut mucosal microbiota from healthy
controls, adenoma patients, and carcinoma patients were analyzed. RESULTS
Principal coordinate analysis of unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance showed 
a separation in composition of microbiota in the 3 groups. Bacteria with
potential tumorigenesis, like Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium, were more
common in the carcinoma group, while some SCFA (short chain fatty
acids) - producing microbes were enriched in the normal group. The commensal
Escherichia were more abundant in adenoma patients. CONCLUSIONS Our study
provides insights into possible function of gut microbiota in diagnosis and
treatment of colorectal cancer. Some bacteria, such as Butyricicoccus, E. coli,
and Fusobacterium, can be used as potential biomarkers for normal, adenoma, and
cancer groups, respectively.

University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Microbiota is a major player in the pathogenesis of
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we summarize
the key advances achieved in the past 18 months (ending June 2017) toward a
better understanding of the role of microbiota in colitis and CRC development.
RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulating evidence shows the essential role of intestinal
barrier function (e.g. mucus, IgA, LCN2, LYPD8) in protecting against
bacteria-induced inflammation and tumor development. Numerous signaling pathways 
(e.g. TLRs and NLRs), metabolites (e.g. indole, bile acids, retinoic acid) and
small noncoding RNAs (e.g. miRNA) have been identified as key mediators
regulating host-microbe interactions in the intestine. Novel microbial drivers of
colitis and tumorigenesis (e.g. Alistipes finegoldii, Atopobium parvalum,
Peptostreptococcus anaerobius) have been identified and their disease-promoting
activities have been described.
SUMMARY: IBD-associated colorectal cancer results from a complex breakdown of
communication between the host and its microbiota, involving barrier function,
immune signaling and metabolites.

INTRODUCTION: A biomarker is a measurable indicator of normal biologic processes,
pathogenic processes or pharmacological responses. The identification of a useful
biomarker is challenging, with several hurdles to overcome before clinical
adoption. This review gives a general overview of a range of biomarkers
associated with inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer along the
gastrointestinal tract. Areas covered: These markers include those that are
already clinically accepted, such as inflammatory markers such as faecal
calprotectin, S100A12 (Calgranulin C), Fatty Acid Binding Proteins (FABP),
malignancy markers such as Faecal Occult Blood, Mucins, Stool DNA, Faecal
microRNA (miRNA), other markers such as Faecal Elastase, Faecal
alpha-1-antitrypsin, Alpha2-macroglobulin and possible future markers such as
microbiota, volatile organic compounds and pH. Expert commentary: There are
currently a few biomarkers that have been sufficiently validated for routine
clinical use at present such as FC. However, many of these biomarkers continue to
be limited in sensitivity and specificity for various GI diseases. Emerging
biomarkers have the potential to improve diagnosis and monitoring but further
study is required to determine efficacy and validate clinical utility.

The influence of unicellular eukaryotic microorganisms on human gut health and
disease is still largely unexplored. Blastocystis spp. commonly colonize the gut,
but its clinical significance and ecological role are currently unsettled. We
have developed a high-sensitivity bioinformatic pipeline to detect Blastocystis
subtypes (STs) from shotgun metagenomics, and applied it to 12 large data sets,
comprising 1689 subjects of different geographic origin, disease status and
lifestyle. We confirmed and extended previous observations on the high prevalence
the microrganism in the population (14.9%), its non-random and ST-specific
distribution, and its ability to cause persistent (asymptomatic) colonization.
These findings, along with the higher prevalence observed in non-westernized
individuals, the lack of positive association with any of the disease considered,
and decreased presence in individuals with dysbiosis associated with colorectal
cancer and Crohn's disease, strongly suggest that Blastocystis is a component of 
the healthy gut microbiome. Further, we found an inverse association between body
mass index and Blastocystis, and strong co-occurrence with archaeal organisms
(Methanobrevibacter smithii) and several bacterial species. The association of
specific microbial community structures with Blastocystis was confirmed by the
high predictability (up to 0.91 area under the curve) of the microorganism
colonization based on the species-level composition of the microbiome. Finally,
we reconstructed and functionally profiled 43 new draft Blastocystis genomes and 
discovered a higher intra subtype variability of ST1 and ST2 compared with ST3
and ST4. Altogether, we provide an in-depth epidemiologic, ecological, and
genomic analysis of Blastocystis, and show how metagenomics can be crucial to
advance population genomics of human parasites.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death in the
western world. An effective screening program leading to early detection of
disease would severely reduce the mortality of CRC. Alterations in the gut
microbiota have been linked to CRC, but the potential of microbial markers for
use in CRC screening has been largely unstudied. We used a nested case-control
study of 238 study subjects to explore the use of microbial markers for clbA+
bacteria harboring the pks pathogenicity island, afa-C+ diffusely adherent
Escherichia coli harboring the afa-1 operon, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in stool
as potential screening markers for CRC. We found that individual markers for
clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum were more abundant in stool of patients with CRC,
and could predict cancer with a relatively high specificity (81.5% and 76.9%,
respectively) and with a sensitivity of 56.4% and 69.2%, respectively. In a
combined test of clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum, CRC was detected with a
specificity of 63.1% and a sensitivity of 84.6%. Our findings support a potential
value of microbial factors in stool as putative noninvasive biomarkers for CRC
detection. We propose that microbial markers may represent an important future
screening strategy for CRC, selecting patients with a "high-risk" microbial
pattern to other further diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy.

Colon cancer induces a state of mucosal dysbiosis with associated niche specific 
changes in the gut microbiota. However, the key metabolic functions of these
bacteria remain unclear. We performed a prospective observational study in
patients undergoing elective surgery for colon cancer without mechanical bowel
preparation (n = 18). Using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing we demonstrated that
microbiota ecology appears to be cancer stage-specific and strongly associated
with histological features of poor prognosis. Fusobacteria (p < 0.007) and ε-
Proteobacteria (p < 0.01) were enriched on tumour when compared to adjacent
normal mucosal tissue, and fusobacteria and β-Proteobacteria levels increased
with advancing cancer stage (p = 0.014 and 0.002 respecitvely). Metabonomic
analysis using 1H Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonsance  (MAS-NMR)
spectroscopy, demonstrated increased abundance of taurine, isoglutamine, choline,
lactate, phenylalanine and tyrosine and decreased levels of lipids and
triglycerides in tumour relative to adjacent healthy tissue. Network analysis
revealed that bacteria associated with poor prognostic features were not
responsible for the modification of the cancer mucosal metabonome. Thus the colon
cancer mucosal microbiome evolves with cancer stage to meet the demands of cancer
metabolism. Passenger microbiota may play a role in the maintenance of cancer
mucosal metabolic homeostasis but these metabolic functions may not be stage
specific.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Altered gut microbiota is implicated in development of
colorectal cancer (CRC). Some intestinal bacteria have been reported to
potentiate intestinal carcinogenesis by producing genotoxins, altering the immune
response and intestinal microenvironment, and activating oncogenic signaling
pathways. We investigated whether stool from patients with CRC could directly
induce colorectal carcinogenesis in mice.
METHODS: We obtained stored stool samples from participants in a metagenome study
performed in Hong Kong. Conventional (male C57BL/6) mice were given azoxymethane 
to induce colon neoplasia after receiving a course of antibiotics in drinking
water. Mice were gavaged twice weekly with stool from 5 patients with CRC or 5
healthy individuals (controls) for 5 weeks. Germ-free C57BL/6 mice were gavaged
once with stool from 5 patients with CRC or 5 controls. We collected intestinal
tissues from mice and performed histology, immunohistochemistry, expression
microarray, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and flow
cytometry analyses. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis of
feces from mice.
RESULTS: Significantly higher proportions of conventional mice fed with stool
from individuals with CRC than control stool developed high-grade dysplasia (P < 
.05) and macroscopic polyps (P < .01). We observed a higher proportion of
proliferating (Ki-67-positive) cells in colons of germ-free mice fed with stool
from patients with CRC vs those fed with stool from controls (P < .05). Feces
from germ-free and conventional mice fed with stool from patients with CRC vs
controls contained different microbial compositions, with lower richness in mice 
fed with stool from patients with CRC. Intestines collected from conventional and
germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with CRC had increased expression of 
cytokines that modulate inflammation, including C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1,
C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2, interleukin 17A (IL17A), IL22, and IL23A.
Intestines from conventional and germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with
CRC contained higher proportions of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (2.25% vs 0.44%)
and Th17 cells (2.08% vs 0.31%) (P < .05 for each) than mice fed with stool from 
controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction arrays revealed up-regulation of
genes involved in cell proliferation, stemness, apoptosis, angiogenesis,
invasiveness, and metastasis in mice fed with stool from patients with CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: We fed stool samples from patients with CRC and heathy individuals
to germ-free mice and conventional mice with azoxymethane. We found stool from
patients with CRC to increase the numbers of polyps, levels of intestinal
dysplasia and proliferation, markers of inflammation, and proportions of Th1 and 
Th17 cells in colon, compared with stool from individuals without CRC. This study
provides evidence that the fecal microbiota from patients with CRC can promote
tumorigenesis in germ-free mice and mice given a carcinogen.

Microbiota refers to a colony of microorganisms, and they are found in all
multicellular organisms. This colony plays a major role in both the physiology
and disease of the organism it inhabits. Much attention has been paid to
host-microbiota interactions, but there has been little investigation on its role
in carcinogenesis. In this study, we characterized a fecal mycobiota, also known 
as fungal signature, for the first time with 131 subjects, comprising polyp and
colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, as well as a healthy control population. The
data obtained were analyzed to assess the biodiversity and composition of the
fungi. The impacts of anatomic position and tumor stage on the mycobiota were
also evaluated. Correlations between fungi were investigated using the Spearman
test. We observed fungal dysbiosis in colon polyps and CRC, including decreased
diversity in polyp patients, an increased Ascomycota/Basidiomycota ratio, and an 
increased proportion of opportunistic fungi Trichosporon and Malassezia, which
might favor the progression of CRC. Subsequent analysis with regard to tumor
stage demonstrated a lower diversity and significant mycobiota alteration in
early-stage tumors. Finally, the fungal correlation showed a close relationship
within the community and concomitantly revealed a dramatically structured
discrepancy in each clinical phenotype. In conclusion, our study has uncovered a 
distinct fungal dysbiosis and an alteration in the fungal network, which could
play important roles in polyp and CRC pathogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic intestinal inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal cancer
(CRC) initiation and development. Diets that are rich in Western style fats have 
been shown to promote CRC. This study was conducted to investigate the role of
intestinal microbiome in American ginseng-mediated CRC chemoprevention in a mouse
model. The population and diversity of enteric microbiome were evaluated after
the ginseng treatment.
METHODS: Using an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced gut
inflammation and tumorigenesis mouse model, the effects of oral American ginseng 
on high fat diet-associated enteric pathology were determined. After
establishment of a 16S rRNA illumina library from fecal samples, MiSeq sequencing
was carried out to reveal the microbial population. The alpha and beta
diversities of microbiome were analyzed.
RESULTS: American ginseng significantly attenuated AOM/DSS-induced colon
inflammation and tumorigenesis by reducing the colitis score and colon tumor
multiplicity. The MiSeq results showed that the majority of sequences fell into
three phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia. Further, two
significant abundance shifts at the family level, Bacteroidaceae and
Porphyromonadaceae, were identified to support ginseng's anti-colitis and
anti-tumor effects. In addition, alpha and beta diversity data demonstrated that 
ginseng led to a profound recovery from the AOM/DSS-induced dysbiosis in the
microbial community.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the CRC chemopreventive effects of American 
ginseng are mediated through enteric microbiome population-shift recovery and
dysbiosis restoration. Ginseng's regulation of the microbiome balance contributes
to the maintenance of enteric homeostasis.

Patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis (UC) have an increased colorectal 
cancer (CRC) risk. In this pilot study we evaluated the effect of
Eicosapentaenoic acid as free fatty acid (EPA-FFA) supplementation on mucosal
disease activity, colonic differentiation markers and microbiota composition in
UC patients. Twenty long-standing UC patients in stable clinical remission and
with fecal calprotectin (FC) > 150 µg/g were enrolled (T0) and supplemented with 
EPA-FFA 2 g/daily for 90 days (T3). Endoscopic and histologic disease activities 
were measured by Mayo and Geboes scores, respectively. HES1, KLF4, STAT3, IL-10
and SOCS3 levels were determined using western blotting and qRT-PCR, while
phospho-STAT3 levels were assessed by western blotting. Goblet cells were stained
by Alcian blue. Microbiota analyses were performed on both fecal and colonic
samples. Nineteen patients completed the study; seventeen (89.5%) were compliant.
EPA-FFA treatment reduced FC levels at T3. Patients with FC > 150 µg/g at T3
(n = 2) were assumed as non-responders. EPA-FFA improved endoscopic and
histological inflammation and induced IL-10, SOCS3, HES1 and KLF4 in compliant
and responder patients. Importantly, long-term UC-driven microbiota composition
was partially redressed by EPA-FFA. In conclusion, EPA-FFA supplementation
reduced mucosal inflammation, promoted goblet cells differentiation and modulated
intestinal microbiota composition in long-standing UC patients.

Gut microbiota are linked to chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis.
Chemotherapy failure is the major cause of recurrence and poor prognosis in
colorectal cancer patients. Here, we investigated the contribution of gut
microbiota to chemoresistance in patients with colorectal cancer. We found that
Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum was abundant in colorectal cancer tissues in
patients with recurrence post chemotherapy, and was associated with patient
clinicopathological characterisitcs. Furthermore, our bioinformatic and
functional studies demonstrated that F. nucleatum promoted colorectal cancer
resistance to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum targeted TLR4 and MYD88
innate immune signaling and specific microRNAs to activate the autophagy pathway 
and alter colorectal cancer chemotherapeutic response. Thus, F. nucleatum
orchestrates a molecular network of the Toll-like receptor, microRNAs, and
autophagy to clinically, biologically, and mechanistically control colorectal
cancer chemoresistance. Measuring and targeting F. nucleatum and its associated
pathway will yield valuable insight into clinical management and may ameliorate
colorectal cancer patient outcomes.

The tumor microenvironment has recently been shown to play decisive roles in
chemotherapeutic response. In this issue of Cell, Yu et al. add to these findings
by identifying the bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum as a previously unrecognized
chemoresistance mediator in colorectal cancer, thereby establishing the
microbiota as a potential therapeutic target.

Natural compounds can alter the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome, 
potentially benefiting our health. We previously demonstrated chemopreventive
effects of black raspberries (BRBs) in colorectal cancer, which is associated
with gut dysbiosis. To investigate the effects of whole BRBs and their fractions 
on gut microbiota, we fed F-344 rats a control diet, 5% BRBs, the BRB anthocyanin
fraction, or the BRB residue fraction for 6 weeks. Feces were collected at
baseline and at weeks 3 and 6, and bacterial sequence counts were analyzed. We
observed distinct patterns of microbiota from different diet groups. Beta
diversity analysis suggested that all diet groups exerted time-dependent changes 
in the bacterial diversity. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that
post-diet fecal microbiota was segregated from baseline fecal microbiota within
each diet. It is interesting to note that fractions of BRBs induced different
changes in gut bacteria compared to whole BRBs. The abundance of specific
microbial species known to have anti-inflammatory effects, such as Akkermansia
and Desulfovibrio, was increased by whole BRBs and their residue. Further,
butyrate-producing bacteria, e.g., Anaerostipes, were increased by whole BRBs.
Our results suggest that whole BRBs and their fractions alter the gut microbiota 
in ways that could significantly influence human health.

BACKGROUND: Studies on gut microbiota regarding colorectal carcinogenesis,
including sessile serrated adenoma (SSA), have been scarce. The aim of this study
is to investigate the role of mucosa-associated gut microbiota in the colorectal 
carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We collected biopsy samples of normal rectal mucosa during colonoscopy
from healthy control and patients with conventional adenoma, SSA, and colorectal 
cancer (CRC), respectively (n = 6). Pyrosequencing for 16S rRNA gene of bacteria 
was performed to compare gut microbiota.
RESULTS: The most abundant phylum in total samples was Proteobacteria (55.6%),
followed by Firmicutes (27.4%) and Bacteroidetes (11.6%). There was no
significant difference in relative abundance of the phylum level among the four
groups. Fusobacterium nucleatum, known to be frequently detected during
colorectal carcinogenesis, was found in only one sample of patient with SSA. The 
rarefaction curves showed that the diversity of mucosal communities of patients
with CRC is the lowest among the four groups and the diversity of mucosal
communities of patients with SSA is higher than that of healthy control. Among
the four groups, Shannon's and Simpson's index for diversity was the lowest and
the highest in the patients with CRC, respectively; it did not reach statistical 
significance. The proportion of genus Pseudomonas was very high in the samples of
patients with stage II-IV CRC compared with those with stage I CRC (59.3% vs.
0.3%, P = 0.064).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests no significant role of mucosa-associated gut
microbiota in the colorectal carcinogenesis. Further study for many samples or
using fecal material could be helpful.

Therapy of colorectal cancer (CRC), especially a subset known as locally advanced
rectal cancer, is challenged by progression and recurrence. Sphingolipids, a
lipid subtype with vital roles in cellular function, play an important role in
CRC and impact on therapeutic outcomes. In this review we discuss how dietary
sphingolipids or the gut microbiome via alterations in sphingolipids influence
CRC carcinogenesis. In addition, we discuss the expression of sphingolipid
enzymes in the gastro-intestinal tract, their alterations in CRC, and the
implications for therapy responsiveness. Lastly, we highlight some novel
therapeutics that target sphingolipid signaling and have potential applications
in the treatment of CRC. Understanding how sphingolipid metabolism impacts cell
death susceptibility and drug resistance will be critical toward improving
therapeutic outcomes.

communities?

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third commonest malignant tumor. Previous studies 
have revealed that the composition change of the human gut microbiome, measured
by community diversity, is associated with the progression of CRC. However, a
further question, whether or not the mechanism of community assembly and
diversity maintenance of the gut microbiome is influenced by CRC has not been
addressed. To address this question, we applied Hubbell's neutral theory for
biodiversity to reanalyze the dataset from Wang et al.'s (2012) study of the gut 
microbiome sampled from 46 CRC patients and 56 healthy individuals. Our
reanalysis presents two important findings. Firstly, our analysis demonstrated
that only around 4% (4/102) samples (in total of both the CRC and control groups)
have their species abundance distribution (SAD) satisfied the prediction of the
neutral theory null model. No significant difference in the number of the samples
satisfying the neutral null model was detected between the healthy individuals
and CRC patients, suggesting that the nature or mechanism of community assembly
and diversity maintenance of the gut microbiome is not significantly influenced
by CRC. That is, the stochasticity of survival, reproduction and migration of gut
microbes, as implied by the neutral theory model, does not play a significant
role in shaping the community assembly and diversity maintenance. We further
infer that the alternative hypothesis to the neutral null model, i.e., the
deterministic niche differentiations should be the driving forces that shape the 
assembly and diversity maintenance of the gut microbiome in both the healthy
individuals and CRC patients. Secondly, although CRC does not seem to influence
the nature of community assembly, we postulate that it may indirectly influence
the outcome (i.e., the community composition as measured by community diversity) 
of the community assembly, possibly by influencing niche differentiations. This
postulation is supported by our second finding: the diversity of the gut
microbiome in CRC patients is significantly lower than that in the healthy
individuals as demonstrated by the fundamental diversity parameter (θ) of the
neutral theory model. This second finding offers an independent confirmation of
the relationship between the CRC disease and diversity of the gut microbiome,
about which existing studies have presented conflicting evidences. Finally, we
suggest that hybrid modeling which integrates both the neutral and niche theories
should be explored in future studies to further understanding of the CRC
influence on the human gut microbiome.

Rice bran (RB) consumption has been shown to reduce colorectal cancer (CRC)
growth in mice and modify the human stool microbiome. Changes in host and
microbial metabolism induced by RB consumption was hypothesised to modulate the
stool metabolite profile in favour of promoting gut health and inhibiting CRC
growth. The objective was to integrate gut microbial metabolite profiles and
identify metabolic pathway networks for CRC chemoprevention using non-targeted
metabolomics. In all, nineteen CRC survivors participated in a parallel
randomised controlled dietary intervention trial that included daily consumption 
of study-provided foods with heat-stabilised RB (30 g/d) or no additional
ingredient (control). Stool samples were collected at baseline and 4 weeks and
analysed using GC-MS and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-MS. Stool
metabolomics revealed 93 significantly different metabolites in individuals
consuming RB. A 264-fold increase in β-hydroxyisovaleroylcarnitine and 18-fold
increase in β-hydroxyisovalerate exemplified changes in leucine, isoleucine and
valine metabolism in the RB group. A total of thirty-nine stool metabolites were 
significantly different between RB and control groups, including increased
hesperidin (28-fold) and narirutin (14-fold). Metabolic pathways impacted in the 
RB group over time included advanced glycation end products, steroids and bile
acids. Fatty acid, leucine/valine and vitamin B6 metabolic pathways were
increased in RB compared with control. There were 453 metabolites identified in
the RB food metabolome, thirty-nine of which were identified in stool from RB
consumers. RB consumption favourably modulated the stool metabolome of CRC
survivors and these findings suggest the need for continued dietary CRC
chemoprevention efforts.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review we discuss how environmental exposures
predominate the etiology of colorectal cancer (CRC). With CRC being a
personalized disease influenced by genes and environment, our goal was to explore
the role metabolomics can play in identifying exposures, assessing the interplay 
between co-exposures, and the development of personalized therapeutic
interventions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately 10 % of CRC cases can be explained by germ-line
mutations, whereas the prevailing majority are caused by an initiating exposure
event occurring decades prior to diagnosis. Recent research has shown that
dietary metabolites are linked to a procarcinogenic or protective environment in 
the colon which is modulated by the microbiome. In addition, excessive alcohol
has been shown to increase the risk of CRC and is dependent on diet (folate), the
response of microbiome, and genetic polymorphisms within the folate and alcohol
metabolic pathways. Metabolomics can not only be used to identify this modulation
of host metabolism, which could affect the progression of the tumors but also
response to targeted therapeutics.
SUMMARY: This review highlights the current understanding of the multifaceted
etiology and mechanisms of CRC development but also highlights where the field of
metabolomics can contribute to a greater understanding of environmental exposure 
in CRC.

Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) as a New Potential Therapeutic Target for Insulin
Resistance and Cancer.

BACKGROUND: The intake of animal products in food has been associated with both
the development of insulin resistance and gastrointestinal cancers (GIC). Through
the digestion of animal protein and other constituents of animal products, the
commensal bacteria in the gut (the gut microbiota) forms metabolites that can
contribute to the development of both insulin resistance and cancer.
Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO) is such a molecule and has recently drawn a lot of 
attention as it may be a risk factor for - and a link between - the gut
microbiota and cardiovascular and renal disease. Further, TMAO is anticipated to 
have significance as a biomarker of - or even an independent risk factor for -
other undesirable conditions, including insulin resistance and GIC. TMAO
originates from a precursor, trimethylamine (TMA) that is a metabolite of various
precursors; mainly choline and carnitine from ingested foods.
METHODS: We review the literature on TMAO as a shared risk factor and/or pathway 
between insulin resistance and GIC risk and take the reader through the
literature of interventions that could reduce formation of TMAO and thereby the
risk of insulin resistance and GIC. The purpose of the work is to generate a
hypothesis to be tested in preclinical and clinical studies.
RESULTS: TMAO seems to be associated with both insulin resistance and GIC risk
and also with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. One shared pathway is the
formation of N-Nitroso compounds, a group of metabolites that can cause
DNA-damage and epigenetic changes. Levels of TMAO can be reduced by limiting the 
dietary intake of certain foods, most importantly animal products. Further,
certain drugs, namely Meldonium and 3,3-dimethyl- 1-butanol, may inhibit the
formation of TMAO by inhibiting bacterial enzymes.
CONCLUSIONS: The TMAO pathway and its metabolites are possibly involved in the
development of two major health problems: insulin resistance and cancer. Within
these pathways novel therapeutic targets may be identified. Further research is
needed in order to verify existing or develop new pharmacological agents that
modify these pathways and reduce the risk of insulin resistance and GIC.

The aim of this study was to explore the gut microbiota profiles of colorectal
cancer (CRC) patients and to examine the relationship between gut microbiota and 
other key molecular factors involved in CRC tumorigenesis. In this study, a 16S
rDNA sequencing platform was used to identify possible differences in the
microbiota signature between CRC and adjacent normal mucosal tissue. Differences 
in the microbiota composition in different anatomical colorectal tumor sites and 
their potential association with KRAS mutation were also explored. In this study,
the number of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria decreased, while the number of
Fusobacteria increased in the gut of CRC patients. In addition, at the genus
level, Fusobacterium was identified as the key contributor to CRC tumorigenesis. 
In addition, a different distribution of gut microbiota in ascending and
descending colon cancer samples was observed. Lipopolysaccharide
biosynthesis-associated microbial genes were enriched in tumor tissues. Our study
suggests that specific mucosa-associated microbiota signature and function are
significantly changed in the gut of CRC patients, which may provide insight into 
the progression of CRC. These findings could also be of value in the creation of 
new prevention and treatment strategies for this type of cancer.

Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat-containing proteins (NLRs) are
intracellular innate immune sensors of pathogen-associated and damage-associated 
molecular patterns. NLRs regulate diverse biologic processes such as inflammatory
responses, cell proliferation and death, and gut microbiota to attenuate
tumorigenesis. In a recent publication in Nature, we identified NLRC3 as a
negative regulator of PI3K-mTOR signaling and characterized its potential tumor
suppressor function. Enterocytes lacking NLRC3 cannot control cellular
proliferation because they are unable to suppress activation of PI3K-mTOR
signaling pathways. In this Extra-View, we explore possible mechanisms through
which NLRC3 regulates cellular proliferation and cell death. Besides interacting 
with PI3K, NLRC3 associates with TRAF6 and mTOR, confirming our recent finding
that NLRC3 negatively regulates the PI3K-mTOR axis. Herein, we show that NLRC3
suppresses c-Myc expression and activation of PI3K-AKT targets FoxO3a and FoxO1
in the colon of Nlrc3-/- mice, suggesting that additional signaling pathways
contribute to increased cellular proliferation. Moreover, NLRC3 suppresses
colorectal tumorigenesis by promoting cellular apoptosis. Genes encoding
intestinal stem cell markers BMI1 and OLFM4 are upregulated in the colon of
Nlrc3-/- mice. Herein, we discuss recent findings and explore mechanisms through 
which NLRC3 regulates PI3K-mTOR signaling. Our studies highlight the therapeutic 
potential of modulating NLRC3 to prevent and treat cancer.

Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a specific species of gut microbiota, has been
suggested to be enriched in the microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) molecular
subtype of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). However, the clinicopathologic and
molecular factors that interact with Fn in MSI-H CRCs are poorly understood. In
this study, 16S ribosomal RNA gene DNA sequence of Fn was quantitatively measured
by real-time polymerase chain reaction in tumor DNA samples from a total of 160
surgically resected MSI-H CRC tissues. Each case was classified into one of the
three categories based on the Fn DNA amount: Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative.
The clinicopathologic and molecular associations of Fn in MSI-H CRCs were
statistically analyzed. Among the 160 MSI-H CRC samples, 15 (9%), 92 (58%), and
53 (33%) cases were Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative, respectively. Compared with
Fn-low/negative tumors, Fn-high MSI-H CRCs were significantly associated with a
high density of CD68+ tumor-infiltrating macrophages (P = 0.019) and promoter CpG
island hypermethylation of the CDKN2A (p16) gene (P = 0.008). There were also
tendencies toward associations of Fn-high with the BRAF V600E mutation
(P = 0.047) and active Crohn-like lymphoid reactions (P = 0.052) in MSI-H CRCs.
However, Fn-high was not significantly associated with CD3+ T cell density,
CD163+ M2 macrophage density or PD-L1 expression status. In conclusion, high
amounts of intratumoral Fn are correlated with increased macrophage infiltration 
and CDKN2A promoter methylation in MSI-H CRCs.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in both
men and women. The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as having an
important role in human health and disease. Fusobacterium has been identified in 
former studies as a leading gut bacterium associated with colorectal cancer, but 
it is still not clear if it plays an oncogenic role. In the current study, fecal 
samples were collected prior to bowel preparation from participants of screening 
colonoscopy in the German BliTz study. Using 16S rRNA gene analysis, we examined 
the presence and relative abundance of Fusobacterium in fecal samples from 500
participants, including 46, 113, 110 and 231 individuals with colorectal cancer, 
advanced adenomas, non-advanced adenomas and without any neoplasms, respectively.
We found that the abundance of Fusobacterium in feces was strongly associated
with the presence of colorectal cancer (P-value < 0.0001). This was confirmed by 
PCR at the species level for Fusobacterium nucleatum. However, no association was
seen with the presence of advanced adenomas (P-value = 0.80) or non-advanced
adenomas (P-value = 0.80), nor were there any associations observed with dietary 
or lifestyle habits. Although a causal role cannot be ruled out, our
observations, based on fecal microbiome, support the hypothesis that
Fusobacterium is a passenger that multiplies in the more favorable conditions
caused by the malignant tumor rather than a causal factor in colorectal cancer
development.

Long-term dietary intake influences the structure and activity of microorganisms 
residing in the human gut. The immune response and gut microbiota have a mutual
influence on the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study examines the
association of gut microbiota-related dietary factors and polymorphisms in the
microRNA-binding site of the interleukin 13 gene (IL13) with the risk and
prognosis of CRC. Three polymorphisms (rs847, rs848, and rs1295685) were selected
for genotyping in a case-control study (513 cases, 572 controls), and 386 CRC
patients were followed up. Two dietary factors closely related with gut
microbiota (allium vegetables, overnight meal) were significantly associated with
CRC development. Although the three SNPs showed no statistically significant
associations with the risk and prognosis of CRC, a significant antagonistic
interaction was found between rs848 (G-T) and allium vegetable intake (ORi (odds 
ratio of interaction), 0.92; 95% CI (confidence interval): 0.86, 0.99; P = 0.03);
moreover, significant combined and synergistic interactions were observed for all
three SNPs and overnight meal intake. This is the first report of significant
combined and interactive effects between dietary factors and polymorphisms in the
microRNA binding site of IL13 in CRC and may provide direct guidance on intake of
allium vegetable and overnight meals for individuals with specific genetic
variants of IL13 to modify their susceptibility to CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by major inter-tumor diversity that
complicates the prediction of disease and treatment outcomes. Recent efforts help
resolve this by sub-classification of CRC into natural molecular subtypes;
however, this strategy is not yet able to provide clinicians with improved tools 
for decision making. We here present an extended framework for CRC stratification
that specifically aims to improve patient prognostication. Using transcriptional 
profiles from 1,100 CRCs, including >300 previously unpublished samples, we
identify cancer cell and tumor archetypes and suggest the tumor microenvironment 
as a major prognostic determinant that can be influenced by the microbiome.
Notably, our subtyping strategy allowed identification of archetype-specific
prognostic biomarkers that provided information beyond and independent of
UICC-TNM staging, MSI status, and consensus molecular subtyping. The results
illustrate that our extended subtyping framework, combining subtyping and
subtype-specific biomarkers, could contribute to improved patient prognostication
and may form a strong basis for future studies.

There is a common agreement on the important role of the gastrointestinal
microbiota in the etiology of cancer. Benign probiotic yeast strains are able to 
ameliorate intestinal microbiota and regulate the host metabolism, physiology,
and immune system through anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and anticancer
effects. We hypothesized that Pichia kudriavzevii AS-12 secretion metabolites
possess anticancer activity on human colorectal cancer cells (HT-29, Caco-2) via 
inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis. This study aimed to assess the
anticancer effect of P. kudriavzevii AS-12 secretion metabolites and the
underlying mechanisms. The cytotoxicity evaluations were performed via
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay;
4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining; and FACS-flow cytometry tests. Also, the 
effects of P. kudriavzevii AS-12 secretion metabolites on the expression level of
6 important genes (BAD, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9 and Fas-R)
involved in the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways were studied by
real-time polymerase chain reaction method. P. kudriavzevii AS-12 secretion
metabolites showed significant (P < .0001) cytotoxic effects on HT-29 cells
(57.5%) and Caco-2 (32.5%) compared to KDR/293 normal cells (25%). Moreover, the 
cytotoxic effects of examined yeast supernatant on HT-29 cells were comparable
with 5-fluorouracil, as a positive control (57.5% versus 62.2% respectively).
Flow cytometric results showed that the induction of apoptosis is the main
mechanism of the anticancer effects. Also, according to the reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction results, the expression level of proapoptotic genes
(BAD, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9, and Fas-R) in treated HT-29 and Caco-2
cells was higher than untreated and normal cells, whereas the antiapoptotic gene 
(Bcl-2) was downregulated. P. kudriavzevii AS-12 secretion metabolites exert its 
anticancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing intrinsic and
extrinsic apoptosis in colon cancer cells.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is third most common cancer worldwide with
very heterogenous character. In most cases, it is caused by sporadic events
leading to disruption of epithelial cells of the colon. The minority evolves from
germline mutations associated with hereditary cancer syndromes. Mechanisms
leading to mutations of oncogenes, tumour suppressors and genes of DNA repair
mechanisms include: 1. chromosomal instability, 2. microsatellite instability and
3. CpG island methylator phenotype. Microsatellite instability (MSI) usually
arises from a germline mutation of the component of mismatch repair machinery
(MMR) or somatic hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. The diagnostic approaches
include PCR methods and immunohistochemistry for the detection of the loss of MMR
part. The aim of our study was to characterise the cohort of ongoing study of gut
microbiome in CRC patients considering MSI.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The consecutive study group consisted of 103 patients
diagnosed with CRC. The cohort consisted of 45 women (43.7%) and 58 men (56.3%). 
Patient age at the time of diagnosis was within the range of 31-83 years (median 
66 years). The expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 proteins was detected by
immunohistochemical method and the positivity was correlated with the stage and
the localization of the primary tumour.
RESULTS: The MMR status was determined by immunohistochemical method in 43
(41.7%) from the existing total of 103 patients. MSI was detected in 11 (25.6%)
cases while 32 (74.4%) were microsatellite stabile. With the respect to cancer
clasification the most cases of MSI was detected in stage II (8 cases; 22.2%). In
regard to localization of primary tumour, MSI rather correlates to right site
CRC, while microsatellite stable tumours do not show any site preferences.
CONCLUSION: Considering low number of MMR status determination in study group,
statistic evaluation is inaccurate so far. However there is a trend in our cohort
in relation to determination of the portion of MSI in CRC population and also in 
localization of primary tumour according to literature.Key words: colorectal

Reducing Cancer Burden in the Population: An Overview of Epidemiologic Evidence
to Support Policies, Systems, and Environmental Changes.

Platz EA.

"Reducing Cancer Burden in the Population: Epidemiologic Evidence to Support
Policies, Systems, and Environmental Changes" is a compilation of 11 reviews
addressing aspects of primary prevention of cancer (early life factors, vitamin
D, and periodontal disease and the oral microbiome); primary and secondary
prevention (in the transgender population); surveillance following secondary
prevention (personalizing follow-up of patients diagnosed with an adenoma based
on colorectal cancer risk); tertiary prevention (physical activity as an adjuvant
to cancer treatment, measurement of patient-reported physical functioning in
cancer treatment trials, and implementation of palliative care recommendations); 
and all 3 (changing epidemiology of oral cancers). Authors discuss policies,
systems, and environment (PSE) changes that may be supported by epidemiologic
evidence, for example, how existing public health and clinical policies and
guidelines targeting noncancer outcomes may indirectly reduce cancer burden and
how some cancer control policies could be refined to enhance effectiveness.
Authors also discuss where systems and environment changes are necessary to
ensure routine implementation of up-to-date, evidence-based policies and
guidelines. Two other articles discuss infrastructure to support identification
of existing and emerging cancer problems that could be reduced or avoided,
including by PSE changes. These frameworks may guide impactful cancer research
relevant to cancer centers' catchment areas, as well as cancer control efforts in
countries where noncommunicable diseases including cancer are on the rise. The
weight of the evidence of these reviews supports opportunities for PSE changes
and infrastructure that could reduce the cancer burden in populations.

PURPOSE: Investigate in patients with metastatic and/or irresectable colorectal
cancer treated with systemic treatment with capecitabine or TAS-102 whether: 1.
Intestinal microbiota composition can act as a predictor for response. 2.
Intestinal microbiota composition changes during systemic treatment and its
relation to chemotoxicity.
BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota and host determinants evolve in symbiotic and
dependent relationships resulting in a personal ecosystem. In vitro studies
showed prolonged and increased response to 5-fluorouracil, a fluoropyrimidine, in
the presence of a favorable microbiota composition. Capecitabine and TAS-102 are 
both fluoropyrimidines used for systemic treatment in colorectal cancer patients.
METHODS: An explorative prospective multicenter cohort study in the Maastricht
University Medical Centre+ and Zuyderland Medical Centre will be performed in 66 
patients. Before, during, and after three cycles of systemic treatment with
capecitabine or TAS-102, fecal samples and questionnaires (concerning compliance 
and chemotoxicity) will be collected. The response will be measured by CT/MRI
using RECIST-criteria. Fecal microbiota composition will be analyzed with 16S
rRNA next-generation sequencing. The absolute bacterial abundance will be
assessed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Multivariate analysis will 
be used for statistical analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We aim to detect a microbiota composition that predicts if patients 
with metastatic and/or irresectable colorectal cancer will respond to systemic
treatment and/or experience zero to limited chemotoxicity. If we are able to
identify a favorable microbiota composition, fecal microbiota transplantation
might be the low-burden alternative to chemotherapy switch in the future.

Fluoropyrimidines are the first-line treatment for colorectal cancer, but their
efficacy is highly variable between patients. We queried whether gut microbes, a 
known source of inter-individual variability, impacted drug efficacy. Combining
two tractable genetic models, the bacterium E. coli and the nematode C. elegans, 
we performed three-way high-throughput screens that unraveled the complexity
underlying host-microbe-drug interactions. We report that microbes can bolster or
suppress the effects of fluoropyrimidines through metabolic drug interconversion 
involving bacterial vitamin B6, B9, and ribonucleotide metabolism. Also,
disturbances in bacterial deoxynucleotide pools amplify 5-FU-induced autophagy
and cell death in host cells, an effect regulated by the nucleoside diphosphate
kinase ndk-1. Our data suggest a two-way bacterial mediation of fluoropyrimidine 
effects on host metabolism, which contributes to drug efficacy. These findings
highlight the potential therapeutic power of manipulating intestinal microbiota
to ensure host metabolic health and treat disease.

HuR is an RNA-binding protein implicated in immune homeostasis and various
cancers, including colorectal cancer. HuR binding to AU-rich elements within the 
3' untranslated region of mRNAs encoding oncogenes, growth factors, and various
cytokines leads message stability and translation. In this study, we evaluated
HuR as a small-molecule target for preventing colorectal cancer in high-risk
groups such as those with familial adenomatosis polyposis (FAP) or inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). In human specimens, levels of cytoplasmic HuR were increased
in colonic epithelial cells from patients with IBD, IBD-cancer, FAP-adenoma, and 
colorectal cancer, but not in patients with IBD-dysplasia. Intraperitoneal
injection of the HuR small-molecule inhibitor MS-444 in AOM/DSS mice, a model of 
IBD and inflammatory colon cancer, augmented DSS-induced weight loss and
increased tumor multiplicity, size, and invasiveness. MS-444 treatment also
abrogated tumor cell apoptosis and depleted tumor-associated eosinophils,
accompanied by a decrease in IL18 and eotaxin-1. In contrast, HuR inhibition in
APCMin mice, a model of FAP and colon cancer, diminished the number of small
intestinal tumors generated. In this setting, fecal microbiota, evaluated by 16S 
rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, shifted to a state of reduced bacterial diversity,
with an increased representation of Prevotella, Akkermansia, and Lachnospiraceae 
Taken together, our results indicate that HuR activation is an early event in
FAP-adenoma but is not present in IBD-dysplasia. Furthermore, our results offer a
preclinical proof of concept for HuR inhibition as an effective means of FAP
chemoprevention, with caution advised in the setting of IBD. Cancer Res; 77(9);

Inflammation and microbiota are critical components of intestinal tumorigenesis. 
To dissect how the microbiota contributes to tumor distribution, we generated
germ-free (GF) ApcMin/+ and ApcMin/+ ;Il10-/- mice and exposed them to
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) or colorectal cancer-associated bacteria. We found
that colon tumorigenesis significantly correlated with inflammation in SPF-housed
ApcMin/+ ;Il10-/- , but not in ApcMin/+ mice. In contrast, small intestinal
neoplasia development significantly correlated with age in both ApcMin/+ ;Il10-/-
and ApcMin/+ mice. GF ApcMin/+ ;Il10-/- mice conventionalized by an SPF
microbiota had significantly more colon tumors compared with GF mice. Gnotobiotic
studies revealed that while Fusobacterium nucleatum clinical isolates with FadA
and Fap2 adhesins failed to induce inflammation and tumorigenesis,
pks+Escherichia coli promoted tumorigenesis in the ApcMin/+ ;Il10-/- model in a
colibactin-dependent manner, suggesting colibactin is a driver of carcinogenesis.
Our results suggest a distinct etiology of cancers in different locations of the 
gut, where colon cancer is primarily driven by inflammation and the microbiome,
while age is a driving force for small intestine cancer. Cancer Res; 77(10);

PURPOSE: The protective function of the intestinal mucosa largely depends on
carbohydrate moieties that as a part of glycoproteins and glycolipids form the
epithelial glycocalyx or are secreted as mucins. Modifications of their
expression can be induced by an altered intestinal microenvironment and have been
associated with inflammatory disorders and colorectal cancer. Given the influence
of dietary factors on the gut ecosystem, here we have investigated whether a long
term feeding on a starch-rich diet can modulate the glucidic profile in the
colonic mucosa of rats.
METHODS: Animals were divided into two groups and maintained for 9 months at
different diets: one group was fed a standard diet, the second was fed a
starch-enriched diet. Samples of colonic mucosa, divided in proximal and distal
portions, were processed for microscopic analysis. Conventional stainings and
lectin histochemistry were applied to identify acidic glycoconjugates and
specific sugar residues in oligosaccharide chains, respectively. Some lectins
were applied on adjacent sections after sialidase/fucosidase digestion,
deacetylation, and oxidation to characterize either terminal dimers or sialic
acid acetylation.
RESULTS: An increase in sulfomucins was found to be associated with the
starch-enriched diet that affected also the expression of several sugar residues 
as well as fucosylated and sialylated sequences in both proximal and distal
colon.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanisms leading to such a modulation are at present 
unknown, either an altered intestinal microbiota or a dysregulation of
glycosylation patterns might be responsible for the types and distribution of
changes in the glucidic profile here observed.

OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that antibiotic use, which alters the gut
microbiome, is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. However,
the association between antibiotic use and risk of colorectal adenoma, the
precursor for the majority of colorectal cancers, has not been investigated.
DESIGN: We prospectively evaluated the association between antibiotic use at age 
20-39 and 40-59 (assessed in 2004) and recent antibiotic use (assessed in 2008)
with risk of subsequent colorectal adenoma among 16 642 women aged ≥60 enrolled
in the Nurses' Health Study who underwent at least one colonoscopy through 2010. 
We used multivariate logistic regression to calculate ORs and 95% CIs.
RESULTS: We documented 1195 cases of adenoma. Increasing duration of antibiotic
use at age 20-39 (ptrend=0.002) and 40-59 (ptrend=0.001) was significantly
associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenoma. Compared with non-users,
women who used antibiotics for ≥2 months between age 20 and 39 had a
multivariable OR of 1.36 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.79). Women who used ≥2 months of
antibiotics between age 40 and 59 had a multivariable OR of 1.69 (95% CI 1.24 to 
2.31). The associations were similar for low-risk versus high-risk adenomas (size
≥1 cm, or with tubulovillous/villous histology, or ≥3 detected lesions), but
appeared modestly stronger for proximal compared with distal adenomas. In
contrast, recent antibiotic use within the past four years was not associated
with risk of adenoma (ptrend=0.44).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term antibiotic use in early-to-middle adulthood was associated
with increased risk of colorectal adenoma.

Green cincau (Premna oblongifolia Merr) is an Indonesian food plant with a high
dietary fibre content. Research has shown that dietary fibre mixtures may be more
beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention than a single dietary fibre type. The
aim of this study was to investigate the effects of green cincau extract on short
chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in anaerobic batch cultures inoculated with
human faecal slurries and to compare these to results obtained using different
dietary fibre types (pectin, inulin, and cellulose), singly and in combination.
Furthermore, fermentation supernatants (FSs) were evaluated in Caco-2 cells for
their effect on cell viability, differentiation, and apoptosis. Cincau increased 
total SCFA concentration by increasing acetate and propionate, but not butyrate
concentration. FSs from all dietary fibre sources, including cincau, reduced
Caco-2 cell viability. However, the effects of all FSs on cell viability, cell
differentiation, and apoptosis were not simply explainable by their butyrate
content. In conclusion, products of fermentation of cincau extracts induced cell 
death, but further work is required to understand the mechanism of action. This
study demonstrates for the first time that this Indonesian traditional source of 
dietary fibre may be protective against colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Fecal proteomics has gained increased prominence in recent years.
It can provide insights into the diagnosis and surveillance of many bowel
diseases by both identifying potential biomarkers in stool samples and helping
identify disease-related pathways. Fecal proteomics has already shown its
potential for the discovery and validation of biomarkers for colorectal cancer
screening, and the analysis of fecal microbiota by MALDI-MS for the diagnosis of 
a range of bowel diseases is gaining clinical acceptance. Areas covered: Based on
a comprehensive analysis of the current literature, we introduce the range of
sensitive and specific proteomics methods which comprise the current 'Proteomics 
Toolbox', explain how the integration of fecal proteomics with data
processing/bioinformatics has been used for the identification of potential
biomarkers for both CRC and other gut-related pathologies and analysis of the

The gut microbiota represents a complex and diverse ecosystem with a profound
impact on human health, promoting immune maturation, and host metabolism as well 
as colonization resistance. Important members that have often been disregarded
are the methanogenic archaea. Methanogenic archaea reduce hydrogen levels via the
production of methane, thereby stimulating food fermentation by saccharolytic
bacteria. On the other hand, colonization by archaea has been suggested to
promote a number of gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases such as colorectal
cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and obesity. Archaea have been shown to be
absent during infancy while omnipresent in school-aged children, suggesting that 
colonization may result from environmental exposure during childhood. The factors
that determine the acquisition of methanogenic archaea, however, have remained
undefined. Therefore, we aimed to explore determinants associated with the
acquisition of the two main gastrointestinal archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter
smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae, in children. Within the context of the
KOALA Birth Cohort Study, fecal samples from 472 children aged 6-10 years were
analyzed for the abundance of M. smithii and M. stadtmanae using qPCR.
Environmental factors such as diet, lifestyle, hygiene, child rearing, and
medication were recorded by repeated questionnaires. The relationship between
these determinants and the presence and abundance of archaea was analyzed by
logistic and linear regression respectively. Three hundred and sixty-nine out of 
the 472 children (78.2%) were colonized by M. smithii, and 39 out of the 472
children (8.3%) by M. stadtmanae. The consumption of organic yogurt (odds ratio: 
4.25, CI95: 1.51; 11.95) and the consumption of organic milk (odds ratio: 5.58,
CI95: 1.83; 17.01) were positively associated with the presence of M. smithii. We
subsequently screened raw milk, processed milk, and yogurt samples for
methanogens. We identified milk products as possible source for M. smithii, but
not M. stadtmanae. In conclusion, M. smithii seems present in milk products and
their consumption may determine archaeal gut colonization in children. For the
first time, a large variety of determinants have been explored in association
with gut colonization by methanogenic archaea. Although more information is
needed to confirm and unravel the mechanisms in detail, it provides new insights 
on microbial colonization processes in early life.

OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of
cancer-associated mortality in the USA. The faecal microbiome may provide
non-invasive biomarkers of CRC and indicate transition in the adenoma-carcinoma
sequence. Re-analysing raw sequence and metadata from several studies uniformly, 
we sought to identify a composite and generalisable microbial marker for CRC.
DESIGN: Raw 16S rRNA gene sequence data sets from nine studies were processed
with two pipelines, (1) QIIME closed reference (QIIME-CR) or (2) a
strain-specific method herein termed SS-UP (Strain Select, UPARSE bioinformatics 
pipeline). A total of 509 samples (79 colorectal adenoma, 195 CRC and 235
controls) were analysed. Differential abundance, meta-analysis random effects
regression and machine learning analyses were carried out to determine the
consistency and diagnostic capabilities of potential microbial biomarkers.
RESULTS: Definitive taxa, including Parvimonas micra ATCC 33270, Streptococcus
anginosus and yet-to-be-cultured members of Proteobacteria, were frequently and
significantly increased in stools from patients with CRC compared with controls
across studies and had high discriminatory capacity in diagnostic classification.
Microbiome-based CRC versus control classification produced an area under
receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve of 76.6% in QIIME-CR and 80.3% in 
SS-UP. Combining clinical and microbiome markers gave a diagnostic AUROC of 83.3%
for QIIME-CR and 91.3% for SS-UP.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite technological differences across studies and methods, key
microbial markers emerged as important in classifying CRC cases and such could be
used in a universal diagnostic for the disease. The choice of bioinformatics
pipeline influenced accuracy of classification. Strain-resolved microbial markers
might prove crucial in providing a microbial diagnostic for CRC.

The precise etiology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IDB) remains unclear and
several factors are believed to play a role in its development and progression,
including the composition of microbial communities resident in the
gastrointestinal tract. Human intestinal microbiota are extensive with at least
15,000-36,000 bacterial species. However, thanks to the new development in
sequencing and molecular taxonomic methodologies, our understanding of the
microbiota population composition, dynamics, and ecology has greatly increased.
Intestinal microbiota play a critical role in the maintenance of the host
intestinal barrier homeostasis, while dysbiosis, which involves reduction in the 
microbiome diversity, can lead to progression of inflammatory disorders, such as 
IBD and colorectal cancer. It is hypothesized that fingerprinting
characterization of the microbiota community composition is the first step in the
study of this complex bacterial ecosystem and a crucial step in the targeted
therapy. Molecular fingerprinting of human gastrointestinal tract microbiota
could be performed by different techniques including the semi quantitation,
16SrRNA, the DNA- microarray as well as other relatively new methods which were
developed to study many complex bacterial ecosystems. These techniques provide
individual data and profiles, using fast and sensitive tools for the high
taxonomic level fingerprint of the human intestinal microbiota and provide
estimation of the relative presence of the microbial target groups within each
individual. Such personalized information serves as a remarkable and
unprecedented opportunity to improve targeted medical treatment and probably
develop strategies to prevent disease.

Humans live in symbiosis with billions of commensal bacteria. The so-called
microbiota live on different biological interfaces such as the skin, the
urogenital tract and the gastrointestinal tract. Commensal bacteria replace
potentially pathogenic microbes, synthesize vitamins and ferment dietary fibre.
An imbalance in the bacterial composition of the intestinal microbiota has been
associated with various diseases including gut-associated disorders such as
inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancer and nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease. Furthermore, a shift in the microbiota composition appears to be of
pathophysiological relevance which renders the specific modulation of the
intestinal microbiota a promising approach in the treatment of the above
mentioned diseases. Our intestinal microbiota composition is mainly modulated by 
dietary macro- and micronutrients but also by secondary plant compounds and
synthetic food additives such as emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners.
Nutritional interventions with the purpose to modulate the intestinal microbiota 
show only limited therapeutic potential in the treatment of gut-associated
disorders, which may be due to individual differences in the intestinal
microbiota composition and a lack of specificity. A combination of newly
established technical analytic approaches involving a machine-learning algorithm 
may bridge the currently existing limitations by providing a personalized,
highly-specific and consequently therapeutically effective microbiota modulation.

SCOPE: Boswellia serrata (BS) resin is a popular dietary supplement for joint
nourishment. In this study, we investigated the chemopreventive effects of
dietary BS extract and its impact of gut microbiota on azoxymethane/dextran
sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colitis-associated colon cancer in mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Male ICR mice were injected with AOM and 2% DSS via drinking
water. The mice were fed with 0.25 or 0.5% BS extract, and colonic tissue were
collected at 15 weeks. The main effective components of BS supercritical CO2
extraction were analyzed by LC-MS/MS are boswellic acids. We found that treatment
with BS extract significantly reduce the colonic tumor formation. Western blot
and histological analysis revealed that dietary BS extract could markedly reduce 
the inflammation associated protein levels expression. Furthermore, BS extract
reduced cell proliferation via inhibiting phosphorylation level of protein kinase
B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and downregulation of cyclin D1. In
addition, BS extract also altered the composition of gut microbiota by enhancing 
the proportion of Clostridiales and reducing the percentage of Bacteroidales.
CONCLUSION: In summary, BS extract decreased the protein levels of inflammative
enzymes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in colonic
mucosa. It also mediated Akt/GSK3β/cyclin D1 signaling pathway and altered the
composition of gut microbiota to alleviate tumor growth. Taken together, this
study suggests that BS extract has great potential to suppress colon
tumorigenesis.

The clinical evidence of dietary polyphenols as colorectal cancer (CRC)
chemopreventive compounds is very weak. Verification in humans of tissue-specific
molecular regulation by the intake of polyphenols requires complex clinical
trials that allow for the procurement of sufficient pre- and postsupplementation 
tissue samples. Ellagitannins (ETs), ellagic acid (EA) and their gut
microbiota-derived metabolites, the urolithins, modify gene expression in colon
normal and cancer cultured cells. We conducted here the first clinical trial with
35 CRC patients daily supplemented with 900 mg of an ET-containing pomegranate
extract (PE) and evaluated the expression of various CRC-related genes in normal 
and cancerous colon tissues before (biopsies) and after (surgical specimens) 5-35
days of supplementation. Tissues were also obtained from 10 control patients (no 
supplementation) that confirmed a large, gene- and tissue-specific
interindividual variability and impact of the experimental protocol on gene
expression, with some genes induced (MYC, CD44, CDKN1A, CTNNB1), some repressed
(CASP3) and others not affected (KRAS). Despite these issues, the consumption of 
the PE was significantly associated with a counterbalance effect in the
expression of CD44, CTNNB1, CDKN1A, EGFR and TYMs, suggesting that the intake of 
this PE modulated the impact of the protocol on gene expression in a gene- and
tissue-specific manner. These effects were not associated with the individuals'
capacity to produce specific urolithins (i.e., metabotypes) or the levels of
urolithins and EA in the colon tissues and did not reproduce in vitro effects
evidencing the difficulty of demonstrating in vivo the in vitro results.

OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is higher in African Americans (AAs)
compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). A diet high in animal protein and fat
is an environmental risk factor for CRC development. The intestinal microbiota is
postulated to modulate the effects of diet in promoting or preventing CRC.
Hydrogen sulfide, produced by autochthonous sulfidogenic bacteria, triggers
proinflammatory pathways and hyperproliferation, and is genotoxic. We
hypothesised that sulfidogenic bacterial abundance in colonic mucosa may be an
environmental CRC risk factor that distinguishes AA and NHW.
DESIGN: Colonic biopsies from uninvolved or healthy mucosa from CRC cases and
tumour-free controls were collected prospectively from five medical centres in
Chicago for association studies. Sulfidogenic bacterial abundance in uninvolved
colonic mucosa of AA and NHW CRC cases was compared with normal mucosa of AA and 
NHW controls. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing was performed in AA cases and
controls. Correlations were examined among bacterial targets, race, disease
status and dietary intake.
RESULTS: AAs harboured a greater abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria compared with
NHWs regardless of disease status. Bilophila wadsworthia-specific dsrA was more
abundant in AA cases than controls. Linear discriminant analysis of 16S rRNA gene
sequences revealed five sulfidogenic genera that were more abundant in AA cases. 
Fat and protein intake and daily servings of meat were significantly higher in
AAs compared with NHWs, and multiple dietary components correlated with a higher 
abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria.
CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate sulfidogenic bacteria as a potential
environmental risk factor contributing to CRC development in AAs.

AIM: to investigate the relationship between microbiota composition with HSP70
and Caspase-3 expressions in colon tissue as an initial study to develop the
candidate for early detection of colorectal cancer for Indonesian patients.
METHODS: this is a cross-sectional study on 32 patients undergoing colonoscopy;
16 patients of colorectal cancer (CRC) while the other 16 patients are not
(colitis and internal hemorrhoid). The composition of microbiota in stool samples
was examined using 16S rRNA Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DDGE) while 
expression of HSP70 was examined by immunohistochemistry and Caspase-3 by using
Haematoxylin-Eosin(HE) staining to determine the morphological changes in colon
tissue.
RESULTS: analysis of PCR-DDGE shows a different composition of microbiota between
patients with CRC and non-CRC. All CRC patients showed disappearance of dominant 
band from Bifidobacterium groups. Histological observation based on Inter Class
Correlation (ICC) test from all slide showed a high scores (5.2-9.2) in CRC
patients and low scores (1.7-2.4) in non-CRC patients. HSP70 expression was
increased significantly in CRC patients with the highest percentage of 84%, while
expression of caspase-3 decreased with the highest percentage of 21%. Statistical
analysis showed that the incidence of colorectal cancer was associated with the
expression of HSP 70 (p<0.001), and Caspase 3 (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: bifidobacterium is an important indicator for colorectal cancer
patients that show disappearance of dominant band, while expression of HSP70
increased and the Caspase-3 expression decreased significantly.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stool samples from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have 
a higher abundance of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius than stool from individuals
without CRC, based on metagenome sequencing. We investigated whether P anaerobius
contributes to colon tumor formation in mice and its possible mechanisms of
carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses to measure 
P anaerobius in 112 stool samples and 255 colon biopsies from patients with CRC
or advanced adenoma and from healthy individuals (controls) undergoing
colonoscopy examination at hospitals in Hong Kong and Beijing. C57BL/6 mice were 
given broad-spectrum antibiotics, followed by a single dose of azoxymethane, to
induce colon tumor formation. Three days later, mice were given P anaerobius or
Esherichia coli MG1655 (control bacteria), via gavage, for 6 weeks. Some mice
were also given the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibitor
apocynin. Intestine tissues were collected and analyzed histologically. The colon
epithelial cell line NCM460 and colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and Caco-2 were
exposed to P anaerobius or control bacteria; cells were analyzed by immunoblot,
proliferation, and bacterial attachment analyses and compared in gene expression 
profiling studies. Gene expression was knocked down in these cell lines with
small interfering RNAs.
RESULTS: P anaerobius was significantly enriched in stool samples from patients
with CRC and in biopsies from patients with colorectal adenoma or CRC compared
with controls. Mice depleted of bacteria and exposed to azoxymethane and P
anaerobius had a higher incidence of intestinal dysplasia (63%) compared with
mice not given the bacteria (8.3%; P < .01). P anaerobius mainly colonized the
colon compared with the rest of the intestine. Colon cells exposed to P
anaerobius had significantly higher levels of proliferation than control cells.
We found genes that regulate cholesterol biosynthesis, Toll-like receptor (TLR)
signaling, and AMP-activated protein kinase signaling to be significantly
up-regulated in cells exposed to P anaerobius. Total cholesterol levels were
significantly increased in colon cell lines exposed to P anaerobius via
activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2. P anaerobius
interacted with TLR2 and TLR4 to increase intracellular levels of reactive
oxidative species, which promoted cholesterol synthesis and cell proliferation.
Depletion of reactive oxidative species by knockdown of TLR2 or TLR4, or
incubation of cells with an antioxidant, prevented P anaerobius from inducing
cholesterol biosynthesis and proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of P anaerobius are increased in human colon tumor tissues
and adenomas compared with non-tumor tissues; this bacteria increases colon
dysplasia in a mouse model of CRC. P anaerobius interacts with TLR2 and TLR4 on
colon cells to increase levels of reactive oxidative species, which promotes
cholesterol synthesis and cell proliferation.

Importance: Fusobacterium nucleatum appears to play a role in colorectal
carcinogenesis through suppression of the hosts' immune response to tumor.
Evidence also suggests that diet influences intestinal F nucleatum. However, the 
role of F nucleatum in mediating the relationship between diet and the risk of
colorectal cancer is unknown.
Objective: To test the hypothesis that the associations of prudent diets (rich in
whole grains and dietary fiber) and Western diets (rich in red and processed
meat, refined grains, and desserts) with colorectal cancer risk may differ
according to the presence of F nucleatum in tumor tissue.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study was conducted using
data from the Nurses' Health Study (June 1, 1980, to June 1, 2012) and the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study (June 1, 1986, to June 1, 2012) on a total of
121 700 US female nurses and 51 529 US male health professionals aged 30 to 55
years and 40 to 75 years, respectively (both predominantly white individuals), at
enrollment. Data analysis was performed from March 15, 2015, to August 10, 2016.
Exposures: Prudent and Western diets.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of colorectal carcinoma subclassified by F 
nucleatum status in tumor tissue, determined by quantitative polymerase chain
reaction.
Results: Of the 173 229 individuals considered for the study, 137 217 were
included in the analysis, 47 449 were male (34.6%), and mean (SD) baseline age
for men was 54.0 (9.8) years and for women, 46.3 (7.2) years. A total of 1019
incident colon and rectal cancer cases with available F nucleatum data were
documented over 26 to 32 years of follow-up, encompassing 3 643 562 person-years.
The association of prudent diet with colorectal cancer significantly differed by 
tissue F nucleatum status (P = .01 for heterogeneity); prudent diet score was
associated with a lower risk of F nucleatum-positive cancers (P = .003 for trend;
multivariable hazard ratio of 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25-0.72, for the highest vs the
lowest prudent score quartile) but not with F nucleatum-negative cancers (P = .47
for trend, the corresponding multivariable hazard ratio of 0.95; 95% CI,
0.77-1.17). There was no significant heterogeneity between the subgroups in
relation to Western dietary pattern scores.
Conclusions and Relevance: Prudent diets rich in whole grains and dietary fiber
are associated with a lower risk for F nucleatum-positive colorectal cancer but
not F nucleatum-negative cancer, supporting a potential role for intestinal
microbiota in mediating the association between diet and colorectal neoplasms.

BACKGROUND: The equilibrium of oral microbiome may be altered by environmental
factors, including cigarette smoking. Several recent studies also suggest that
oral pathogens causing periodontal disease, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, are 
involved in pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.
METHODS: For this study oral rinse DNA samples from 190 participants in a
population-based case-control study for colorectal cancer were used to amplify a 
V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The amplicons were sequenced using
Illumina MiSeq paired end chemistry on two runs, yielding approximately 35
million filtered reads which were assigned to bacterial phyla.
RESULTS: No association was found between Fusobacterium abundance or presence and
colorectal cancer. However, adjusted for age and experimental batch, colorectal
cancer history was associated with increased presence of genus Lactobacillus and 
increased relative abundance of Rothia by 28% and current smoking was associated 
with a 33% decrease in relative counts of Betaproteobacteria (primarily
Neisseria) and 23% increase in relative abundance of Veillonellaceae family. We
also found that smoking had significant effects on the 2nd component scores and
2nd coordinate distances in principal component and coordinate analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: It remains to be elucidated whether the observed differences can be 
translated into biochemical changes in oral environment, thus potentially
affecting oral health.

Although genes contribute to colorectal cancer, the gut microbiota are an
important player. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic infection and the
ensuing inflammation contributes to tumor initiation and tumor progression. A
variety of bacterial species and tumor-promoting virulence mechanisms have been
investigated. Significant advances have been made in understanding the
composition and functional capabilities of the gut microbiota and its roles in
cancer. In the current review, we discuss the novel roles of microbiota in the
progression of colon cancer. Although microbiota technically include organisms
other than bacteria e.g., viruses and fungi, this review will primarily focus on 
bacteria. We summarize epidemiological studies of human microbiome and colon
cancer. We discuss the progress in the scientific understanding of the interplay 
between the gut microbiota, barrier function, and host responses in experimental 
models. Further, we discuss the potential application in prevention, diagnosis,
and therapy of colon cancer by targeting microbiota. We discuss the challenges
lie ahead and the future direction in studying gut microbiome in colon cancer to 
close the gap between the basic sciences and clinical application.

Background: Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a choline-derived metabolite produced 
by gut microbiota, and its biomarker precursors have not been adequately
evaluated in relation to colorectal cancer risk.Methods: We investigated the
relationship between serum concentrations of TMAO and its biomarker precursors
(choline, carnitine, and betaine) and incident colorectal cancer risk in a nested
case-control study of male smokers in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer 
Prevention (ATBC) Study. We measured biomarker concentrations in baseline fasting
serum samples from 644 incident colorectal cancer cases and 644 controls using
LC/MS-MS. Logistic regression models estimated the ORs and 95% confidence
interval (CI) for colorectal cancer by quartile (Q) of serum TMAO, choline,
carnitine, and betaine concentrations.Results: Men with higher serum choline at
ATBC baseline had approximately 3-fold greater risk of developing colorectal
cancer over the ensuing (median ± IQR) 14 ± 10 years (in fully adjusted models,
Q4 vs. Q1, OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.24-4.61; Ptrend < 0.0001). The prognostic value of
serum choline for prediction of incident colorectal cancer was similarly robust
for proximal, distal, and rectal colon cancers (all P < 0.0001). The association 
between serum TMAO, carnitine, or betaine and colorectal cancer risk was not
statistically significant (P = 0.25, 0.71, and 0.61, respectively).Conclusions:
Higher serum choline concentration (but not TMAO, carnitine, or betaine) was
associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer.Impact: Serum choline levels 
showed strong prognostic value for prediction of incident colorectal cancer risk 
across all anatomical subsites, suggesting a role of altered choline metabolism
in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(6);

Predicting colorectal cancer (CRC) based on fecal microbiota presents a promising
method for non-invasive screening of CRC, but the optimization of classification 
models remains an unaddressed question. The purpose of this study was to
systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different supervised
machine-learning models in predicting CRC in two independent eastern and western 
populations. The structures of intestinal microflora in feces in Chinese
population (N = 141) were determined by 454 FLX pyrosequencing, and different
supervised classifiers were employed to predict CRC based on fecal microbiota
operational taxonomic unit (OTUs). As a result, Bayes Net and Random Forest
displayed higher accuracies than other algorithms in both populations, although
Bayes Net was found with a lower false negative rate than that of Random Forest. 
Gut microbiota-based prediction was more accurate than the standard fecal occult 
blood test (FOBT), and the combination of both approaches further improved the
prediction accuracy. Moreover, when unclassified OTUs were used as input, the
BayesDMNB text algorithm achieved higher accuracy in the Chinese population
(AUC=0.994). Taken together, our results suggest that Bayes Net classification
model combined with unclassified OTUs may present an accurate method for
predicting CRC based on the compositions of gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (Rig-I) is an intracellular viral RNA 
receptor, which specifically recognizes double-stranded viral RNA initiating
antiviral innate immunity. Increasing evidences showed that Rig-I had broader
roles in antibacterial immunity and cancer protection. However, the potential
roles and mechanisms of Rig-I in gut flora regulation and colorectal cancer (CRC)
progression remain unclear.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect Rig-I protein in 38 pairs
of CRC tissue and matched adjacent mucosa, and immunofluorescence and western
blot were also used to detect Rig-I protein expression in AOM/DSS-induced mice
CRC samples. High-throughput sequencing was conducted to evaluate gut microbiota 
changes in Rig-I-deficient mice. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used 
to detect IgA expression. Additionally, real-time quantitative PCR was performed 
to detect RNA expression in mouse intestines and cultured cells, and western blot
was used to detect phosphorylation of STAT3 in IL-6-stimulated B cell line.
RESULTS: Rig-I was downregulated in human and mouse CRC samples and
Rig-I-deficient mice were more susceptible to AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated 
colorectal cancer (CAC). Furthermore, Rig-I-deficient mice displayed gut
microbiota disturbance compared to wild type mice. IgA, Reg3γ and Pdcd1 levels
were decreased in intestines of Rig-I-deficient mice. Phosphorylation of STAT3 in
IL-6-stimulated 1B4B6 was decreased.
CONCLUSION: Rig-I could regulate gut microbiota through regulating IgA and
IL6-STAT3-dependent Reg3γ expression. Besides, Rig-I could inhibit CRC
progression.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease arising from at least
two precursors-the conventional adenoma (CA) and the serrated polyp. We and
others have previously shown a relationship between the human gut microbiota and 
colorectal cancer; however, its relationship to the different early precursors of
colorectal cancer is understudied. We tested, for the first time, the
relationship of the gut microbiota to specific colorectal polyp types.
RESULTS: Gut microbiota were assessed in 540 colonoscopy-screened adults by 16S
rRNA gene sequencing of stool samples. Participants were categorized as CA cases 
(n = 144), serrated polyp cases (n = 73), or polyp-free controls (n = 323). CA
cases were further classified as proximal (n = 87) or distal (n = 55) and as
non-advanced (n = 121) or advanced (n = 22). Serrated polyp cases were further
classified as hyperplastic polyp (HP; n = 40) or sessile serrated adenoma (SSA;
n = 33). We compared gut microbiota diversity, overall composition, and
normalized taxon abundance among these groups. CA cases had lower species
richness in stool than controls (p = 0.03); in particular, this association was
strongest for advanced CA cases (p = 0.004). In relation to overall microbiota
composition, only distal or advanced CA cases differed significantly from
controls (p = 0.02 and p = 0.002). In taxon-based analysis, stool of CA cases was
depleted in a network of Clostridia operational taxonomic units from families
Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, and enriched in the classes
Bacilli and Gammaproteobacteria, order Enterobacteriales, and genera Actinomyces 
and Streptococcus (all q < 0.10). SSA and HP cases did not differ in diversity or
composition from controls, though sample size for these groups was small. Few
taxa were differentially abundant between HP cases or SSA cases and controls;
among them, class Erysipelotrichi was depleted in SSA cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that gut microbes may play a role in the early 
stages of colorectal carcinogenesis through the development of CAs. Findings may 
have implications for developing colorectal cancer prevention therapies targeting
early microbial drivers of colorectal carcinogenesis.

Sporadic and inflammatory forms of colorectal cancer (CRC) account for more than 
80% of cases. Recent publications have shown mechanistic evidence for the
involvement of gut bacteria in the development of both CRC-forms. Whereas, colon 
and rectal cancer have been routinely studied together as CRC, increasing
evidence show these to be distinct diseases. Also, the common use of fecal
samples to study microbial communities may reflect disease state but possibly not
the tumor microenvironment. We performed this study to evaluate differences in
bacterial communities found in tissue samples of 18 rectal-cancer subjects when
compared to 18 non-cancer controls. Samples were collected during exploratory
colonoscopy (non-cancer group) or during surgery for tumor excision
(rectal-cancer group). High throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4-V5 
region was conducted on the Ion PGM platform, reads were filtered using Qiime and
clustered using UPARSE. We observed significant increases in species richness and
diversity in rectal cancer samples, evidenced by the total number of OTUs and the
Shannon and Simpson indexes. Enterotyping analysis divided our cohort into two
groups, with the majority of rectal cancer samples clustering into one
enterotype, characterized by a greater abundance of Bacteroides and Dorea. At the
phylum level, rectal-cancer samples had increased abundance of candidate phylum
OD1 (also known as Parcubacteria) whilst non-cancer samples had increased
abundance of Planctomycetes. At the genera level, rectal-cancer samples had
higher abundances of Bacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Parabacteroides,
Desulfovibrio, and Odoribacter whereas non-cancer samples had higher abundances
of Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Acinetobacter, Lactobacillus, and Bacillus. Two
Bacteroides fragilis OTUs were more abundant among rectal-cancer patients seen
through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, whose presence was confirmed by
immunohistochemistry and enrichment verified by digital droplet PCR. Our findings
point to increased bacterial richness and diversity in rectal cancer, along with 
several differences in microbial community composition. Our work is the first to 
present evidence for a possible role of bacteria such as B. fragilis and the
phylum Parcubacteria in rectal cancer, emphasizing the need to study
tissue-associated bacteria and specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract in 
order to better understand the possible links between the microbiota and rectal
cancer.

AIMS: With a growing interest in the influence the gut microbiome has on the
development of colorectal cancer (CRC), we investigated the feasibility and
stability of isolating and typing microbial DNA from guaiac faecal occult blood
test (gFOBt) cards. This has the future potential to screen the microbial
populations present in confirmed colorectal neoplasia cases with aims to predict 
the presence and development of CRC.
METHODS: Fresh stool samples from three healthy volunteers were applied to gFOBt 
cards. DNA was extracted from both the cards and fresh stool samples. A series of
additional cards were prepared from one volunteer, and extracted at time points
between 2 weeks and 3 years. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and
sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq at 2×250 bp read lengths. Data were analysed using
QIIME software.
RESULTS: Samples were grouped both by volunteer and by type (fresh or gFOBt), and
compared a variety of ways: visual inspection of taxa, α and β diversity,
intraclass correlation. In all comparisons, samples grouped by volunteer, and not
by sample type. The different time points showed no appreciable differences with 
increased storage time.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that there is good concordance between
microbial DNA isolated from fresh stool sample, and from the matched gFOBt card. 
Samples stored for up to 3 years showed no detrimental effect on measureable
microbial DNA. This study has important future implications for investigating
microbial influence on CRC development and other pathologies.

Intestinal microbiota have emerged as an important factor in colorectal cancer
(CRC) initiation and progression. The currently prominent view on bacterial
tumorigenesis is that CRC initiation is triggered by local mucosal colonization
with specific pathogens (drivers), and that subsequent changes in the peritumoral
environment allow colonization by opportunistic (passenger) microbes, further
facilitating disease progression. Screening for CRC 'driver-passenger'
microorganisms might thus allow early CRC diagnosis or preventive intervention.
Such efforts are now being revolutionized by the notion that CRC initiation and
progression require organization of bacterial communities into higher-order
structures termed biofilms. We explore here the concept that a polymicrobial
biofilm promotes pro-carcinogenic activities that may partially underlie
progression along the adenoma-CRC axis.

The link between intestinal inflammation, microbiota, and colorectal cancer is
intriguing and the potential underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we
evaluate the influence of adrenomedullin (AM) in microbiota composition and its
impact on colitis with an inducible knockout (KO) mouse model for AM. Microbiota 
composition was analyzed in KO and wild type (WT) mice by massive sequencing.
Colitis was induced in mice by administration of azoxymethane (AOM) followed by
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in the drinking water. Colitis was evaluated using a
clinical symptoms index, histopathological analyses, and qRT-PCR. Abrogation of
the adm gene in the whole body was confirmed by PCR and qRT-PCR. KO mice exhibit 
significant changes in colonic microbiota: higher proportion of δ-Proteobacteria 
class; of Coriobacteriales order; and of other families and genera was observed
in KO feces. Meanwhile these mice had a lower proportion of beneficial bacteria, 
such as Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium choerinum. TLR4 gene expression
was higher (p < 0.05) in KO animals. AM deficient mice treated with DSS exhibited
a significantly worse colitis with profound weight loss, severe diarrhea, rectal 
bleeding, colonic inflammation, edema, infiltration, crypt destruction, and
higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. No changes were observed in the
expression levels of adhesion molecules. In conclusion, we have shown that lack
of AM leads to changes in gut microbiota population and in a worsening of colitis
conditions, suggesting that endogenous AM is a protective mediator in this
pathology.

This study evaluates the antiproliferative and antigenotoxic actions of powdered 
red wine pomace seasonings (Sk-S, seedless; W-S, whole; Sd-S, seeds). In vitro
gastrointestinal digested and colonic fermented fractions of the seasonings were 
used as cell treatments. Phenolic acids from Sk-S showed the highest
bioaccessibility in the small intestine, whereas polyphenols contained in Sd-S
might be the most fermentable in the colon. Dietary fiber from Sk-S was the best 
substrate for short chain fatty acids production by gut microbiota. Colon
cancerous (HT-29) cell viability was inhibited by 50% (IC50 values) at treatment 
concentrations ranging from 845 (Sk-S) to 1085 (Sd-S) μg/mL prior digestion, but 
all digested fractions exhibited similar antiproliferative activities (mean IC50 
= 814 μg/mL). Oxidative DNA damage in cells was also attenuated by the treatments
(200 μg/mL, 24 h preincubation), with all colonic fermented fractions displaying 
similar genoprotective action. These results suggest the potential of red wine
pomace seasonings as chemopreventive agents in colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with the modern lifestyle.
Chronic alcohol consumption-a frequent habit of majority of modern
societies-increases the risk of CRC. Our group showed that chronic alcohol
consumption increases polyposis in a mouse mode of CRC. Here we assess the effect
of circadian disruption-another modern life style habit-in promoting
alcohol-associated CRC.
METHOD: TS4Cre × adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)lox468 mice underwent (a) an
alcohol-containing diet while maintained on a normal 12 h light:12 h dark cycle; 
or (b) an alcohol-containing diet in conjunction with circadian disruption by
once-weekly 12 h phase reversals of the light:dark (LD) cycle. Mice were
sacrificed after eight weeks of full alcohol and/or LD shift to collect intestine
samples. Tumor number, size, and histologic grades were compared between animal
groups. Mast cell protease 2 (MCP2) and 6 (MCP6) histology score were analyzed
and compared. Stool collected at baseline and after four weeks of experimental
manipulations was used for microbiota analysis.
RESULTS: The combination of alcohol and LD shifting accelerated intestinal
polyposis, with a significant increase in polyp size, and caused advanced
neoplasia. Consistent with a pathogenic role of stromal tryptase-positive mast
cells in colon carcinogenesis, the ratio of mMCP6 (stromal)/mMCP2
(intraepithelial) mast cells increased upon LD shifting. Baseline microbiota was 
similar between groups, and experimental manipulations resulted in a significant 
difference in the microbiota composition between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Circadian disruption by Light:dark shifting exacerbates
alcohol-induced polyposis and CRC. Effect of circadian disruption could, at least
partly, be mediated by promoting a pro-tumorigenic inflammatory milieu via
changes in microbiota.

The active vitamin D metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) has
important regulatory actions in the gut through endocrine and probably also
intracrine, autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. By activating the vitamin D
receptor (VDR), which is expressed at a high level in the small intestine and
colon, 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates numerous genes that control gut physiology and
homeostasis. 1,25(OH)2D3 is a major responsible for epithelial barrier function
and calcium and phosphate absorption, and the host's defense against pathogens
and the inflammatory response by several types of secretory and immune cells.
Moreover, recent data suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 has a regulatory effect on the gut
microbiota and stromal fibroblasts. Many studies have linked vitamin D deficiency
to inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and to an
increased risk of colorectal cancer, and the possible use of VDR agonists to
prevent or treat these diseases is receiving increasing interest.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence has reported that gut microbiota is involved in
pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and colorectal cancer (CRC), and the
association between PD and CRC does not reach a consensus. In order to explore
their correlation, herein we summarize the epidemiological evidence and included 
relevant studies to perform a meta-analysis.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search for relevant articles published was
performed in Medline, Web of Science and Embase up to June 30, 2016. The pooled
risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to estimate the
effects and calculated using the method of generic inverse variance with the
Random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included and analyzed in this meta-analysis. The
pooled result of 11 cohort studies and 2 case-control studies comprising 343,226 
PD patients showed that patients with PD had a decreased risk of CRC (RR: 0.79,
95% CI: 0.66-0.93, P = 0.006). Further subgroup analyses performed in Western
population revealed that the significant inverse association between PD and risk 
of CRC was not undermined by many factors, including study design, tumor
location, gender and quality of the study.
CONCLUSION: Patients with PD was significantly associated with a decreased risk
of CRC in Western population. Future studies are warranted to further clarify
this association in Asian population.

BACKGROUND: Sequencing-based analysis has become a well-established approach to
deciphering the composition of the gut microbiota. However, due to the complexity
of accessing sufficient material from colonoscopic biopsy samples, most studies
have focused on faecal microbiota analysis, even though it is recognised that
differences exist between the microbial composition of colonic biopsies and
faecal samples. We determined the suitability of colonic lavage samples to see if
it had comparable microbial diversity composition to colonic biopsies as they are
without the limitations associated with sample size. We collected paired colonic 
biopsies and lavage samples from subjects who were attending for colorectal
cancer screening colonoscopy.
RESULTS: Next-generation sequencing and qPCR validation were performed with
multiple bioinformatics analyses to determine the composition and predict
function of the microbiota. Colonic lavage samples contained significantly higher
numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) compared to corresponding biopsy
samples, however, diversity and evenness between lavage and biopsy samples were
similar. The differences seen were driven by the presence of 12 OTUs which were
in higher relative abundance in biopsies and were either not present or in low
relative abundance in lavage samples, whilst a further 3 OTUs were present in
higher amounts in the lavage samples compared to biopsy samples. However,
predicted functional community profiling based on 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid 
(rRNA) data indicated minimal differences between sample types.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that colonic lavage samples provide a relatively accurate
representation of biopsy microbiota composition and should be considered where
biopsy size is an issue.

The molecular biological mechanisms underlying the evolutionary biologic changes 
leading to carcinogenesis remain unclear. The main objective of our study was to 
explore the evolution of the microbiota community and molecules related with CRC 
in the dynamic transition from normal colon epithelium to premalignant adenoma
with the aid of an 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse CRC model induced by DMH.
We generated a modified mouse CRC model induced by DMH for DNA sequences, and
characterized the molecular networks. Data from 454 pyrosequencing of the V3- V5 
region of the 16S rDNA gene and immunohistochemical detection of APC, P53, K-RAS 
and BRAF genes were assessed with Principal coordinates, UniFrac, and
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. The inflammatory group showed enrichment of
Bacteroidetes and Porphyromonadaceae (P < 0.01). OTUs affiliated with Firmicutes 
were enriched in the hyperproliferative group (P < 0.01). Rikenellaceae and
Ruminococcaceae showed an increasing trend during the CRC process while the
opposite pattern was observed for Prevotellaceaeand Enterobacteriaceae. OTUs
related to Alistipes finegoldii were significantly increased during CRC
development, P53, K-RAS and BRAF, were gradually increased (P < 0.05).
Conversely, expression of APC was decreased during the course of development of
CRC. Our results demonstrate that the biological evolutionary shift of gut
microbiota, characterized by a gradual decrease in 'driver' bacteria and an
increase in DNA damage-causing bacteria, is accompanied by tumor development in
the CRC model. The synergistic actions of microbiota dysbiosis and effects of
bacterial metabolites on related molecular events are proposed to contribute to
the progression of CRC tumorigenesis.

Imbalances in intestinal bacteria correlate with colitis-associated colorectal
cancer (CAC). Traditional Chinese medicines have been used to adjust the gut
microbiota, and isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a flavonoid extracted from licorice, has
shown antitumor efficacy. In this study, the effects of ISL on CAC development
and the gut microbiota were evaluated using an azoxymethane and dextran sulphate 
sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced mouse model of CAC (CACM). Histopathological analysis
suggested that ISL reduced tumor incidence in vivo. Moreover, high-throughput
sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) studies
of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that the structure of the gut microbial
community shifted significantly following AOM/DSS treatment, and that effect was 
alleviated by treatment with high-dose ISL (150 mg/kg). Compared to the
microbiota in the control mice (CK), the levels of Bacteroidetes decreased and
the levels of Firmicutes increased during CAC development. ISL reversed the
imbalance at the phylum level and altered the familial constituents of the gut
microbiota. Specifically, the abundance of Helicobacteraceae increased after
treatment with high-dose ISL, while the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and
Rikenellaceae decreased. At the genus level, ISL reduced the abundance of
opportunistic pathogens (Escherichia and Enterococcus), and increased the levels 
of probiotics, particularly butyrate-producing bacteria (Butyricicoccus,
Clostridium, and Ruminococcus). Thus, ISL protects mice from AOM/DSS-induced CAC,
and ISL and the gut microbiota may have synergistic anti-cancer effects.

BACKGROUND: There is a significant demand for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
methods that are noninvasive, inexpensive, and capable of accurately detecting
early stage tumors. It has been shown that models based on the gut microbiota can
complement the fecal occult blood test and fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
However, a barrier to microbiota-based screening is the need to collect and store
a patient's stool sample.
RESULTS: Using stool samples collected from 404 patients, we tested whether the
residual buffer containing resuspended feces in FIT cartridges could be used in
place of intact stool samples. We found that the bacterial DNA isolated from FIT 
cartridges largely recapitulated the community structure and membership of
patients' stool microbiota and that the abundance of bacteria associated with CRC
were conserved. We also found that models for detecting CRC that were generated
using bacterial abundances from FIT cartridges were equally predictive as models 
generated using bacterial abundances from stool.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential for using residual buffer
from FIT cartridges in place of stool for microbiota-based screening for CRC.
This may reduce the need to collect and process separate stool samples and may
facilitate combining FIT and microbiota-based biomarkers into a single test.
Additionally, FIT cartridges could constitute a novel data source for studying
the role of the microbiome in cancer and other diseases.

The increased risks conferred by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to the
development of colorectal cancer gave rise to the term "colitis-associated
cancer" and the concept that inflammation promotes colon tumorigenesis. A
condition more common than IBD is low-grade inflammation, which correlates with
altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic syndrome, both present in many
cases of colorectal cancer. Recent findings suggest that low-grade inflammation
in the intestine is promoted by consumption of dietary emulsifiers, a ubiquitous 
component of processed foods, which alter the composition of gut microbiota.
Here, we demonstrate in a preclinical model of colitis-induced colorectal cancer 
that regular consumption of dietary emulsifiers, carboxymethylcellulose or
polysorbate-80, exacerbated tumor development. Enhanced tumor development was
associated with an altered microbiota metagenome characterized by elevated levels
of lipopolysaccharide and flagellin. We found that emulsifier-induced alterations
in the microbiome were necessary and sufficient to drive alterations in major
proliferation and apoptosis signaling pathways thought to govern tumor
development. Overall, our findings support the concept that perturbations in
host-microbiota interactions that cause low-grade gut inflammation can promote
colon carcinogenesis. Cancer Res; 77(1); 27-40. ©2016 AACR.

Glutathione S-transferase alpha 4 (GSTA4) is a phase II detoxifying enzyme that
metabolizes electrophiles and carcinogens including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), 
an endogenous carcinogen that contributes to colorectal carcinogenesis. In this
study, we investigated GSTA4 expression and regulation in murine primary colonic 
epithelial cells, microbiome-driven murine colitis and human carcinomas. Exposure
of YAMC cells to 4-HNE induced Gsta4 expression. Using an inflammation-associated
model of colorectal cancer (CRC), Gsta4 expression increased in vivo in colon
macrophages and serum after 2 weeks of colonization of IL-10 deficient (Il10-/-) 
mice with Enterococcus faecalis. Increased expression was noted after 9 months of
colonization in colon macrophages and epithelia in areas of inflammation. In
human colon biopsies, immunohistochemistry showed no GSTA4 expression in normal
epithelial cells, whereas GSTA4 was strongly expressed in the neoplastic
epithelia of invasive carcinomas. For tubular adenomas, increased expression was 
primarily noted in stromal macrophages. Increased GSTA4 was confirmed in
established human CRC cell lines and associated with 4-HNE-protein adducts in
human colon adenomas and CRC. Next, we showed that 4-HNE induced activation of
c-Jun and Nrf2, two components of the oncogenic transcription factor AP-1. AP-1
inhibitors and gene-specific small interfering RNAs partially suppressed GSTA4
expression. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed interactions between c-Jun and Nrf2 
supporting a role for AP-1 in regulating 4-HNE-induced GSTA4 expression. These
findings demonstrate GSTA4 activation during 4-HNE-induced neoplastic
transformation in colorectal carcinogenesis. GSTA4 is a potential surrogate
biomarker for CRC screening and should provide novel approaches for
chemoprevention.

Gut dysbiosis may result in various diseases, such as metabolic and
neurobehavioral disorders. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs),
including bisphenol A (BPA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE), especially during
development, may also increase the risk for such disorders. An unexplored
possibility is that EDC-exposure might alter the gut microbial composition. Gut
flora and their products may thus be mediating factors for the disease-causing
effects of these chemicals. To examine the effects of EDCs on the gut microbiome,
female and male monogamous and biparental California mice (Peromyscus
californicus) were exposed to BPA (50 mg/kg feed weight) or EE (0.1 ppb) or
control diet from periconception through weaning. 16s rRNA sequencing was
performed on bacterial DNA isolated from fecal samples, and analyses performed
for P0 and F1 males and females. Both BPA and EE induced generational and
sex-dependent gut microbiome changes. Many of the bacteria, e.g. Bacteroides,
Mollicutes, Prevotellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Akkermansia, Methanobrevibacter,
Sutterella, whose proportions increase with exposure to BPA or EE in the P0 or F1
generation are associated with different disorders, such as inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), metabolic disorders, and colorectal cancer. However, the
proportion of the beneficial bacterium, Bifidobacterium, was also elevated in
fecal samples of BPA- and EE-exposed F1 females. Intestinal flora alterations
were also linked to changes in various metabolic and other pathways. Thus, BPA
and EE exposure may disrupt the normal gut flora, which may in turn result in
systemic effects. Probiotic supplementation might be an effective means to
mitigate disease-promoting effects of these chemicals.

BACKGROUND: Despite many potential effects of the oral microbiome on oral and
systemic health, scant information is available regarding the associations
between diet and the oral microbiome.
METHODS: Oral rinse DNA samples from 182 participants in a population-based
case-control study for colorectal cancer were used to amplify a V3-V4 region of
bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The amplicons were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq paired
end chemistry on 2 runs, yielding approximately 33 million filtered reads that
were assigned to bacterial classes. Relative abundances of each class and family 
as well microbial diversity/richness indices were correlated with selected
dietary intakes from a food frequency questionnaire.
RESULTS: Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and vitamin C intakes were consistently
correlated with alpha (within-subjects) diversity indexes in both richness and
diversity. SFA intake was positively correlated with relative abundance of
betaproteobacteria and fusobacteria. Vitamin C and other vitamins with correlated
intakes-for example, the B vitamins and vitamin E-exhibited positive correlations
with fusobacteria class, its family Leptotrichiaceae and a clostridia family
Lachnospiraceae. In addition, glycemic load was positively correlated with
Lactobacillaceae abundance.
CONCLUSION: The observed associations in this study were modest. However, the
results suggest that the effects of diets are likely to be habitat specific, and 
observations from the gut microbiome are not transferrable to the oral
microbiome. Further studies are warranted, incorporating a range of host
biomarkers, such as cytohistological, molecular, or biochemical measurements, in 
order to address biological consequences of these dietary intakes in human oral
health.

Periodontal diseases including tooth loss might increase systemic inflammation,
lead to immune dysregulation and alter gut microbiota, thereby possibly
influencing colorectal carcinogenesis. Few epidemiological studies have examined 
the association between periodontal diseases and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. We
collected information on the periodontal disease (defined as history of
periodontal bone loss) and number of natural teeth in the Nurses' Health Study. A
total of 77,443 women were followed since 1992. We used Cox proportional hazard
models to calculate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) after adjustment for smoking and other known risk factors for
CRC. We documented 1,165 incident CRC through 2010. Compared to women with 25-32 
teeth, the multivariable HR (95% CI) for CRC for women with <17 teeth was 1.20
(1.04-1.39). With regard to tumor site, the HRs (95% CIs) for the same comparison
were 1.23 (1.01-1.51) for proximal colon cancer, 1.03 (0.76-1.38) for distal
colon cancer and 1.48 (1.07-2.05) for rectal cancer. In addition, compared to
those without periodontal disease, HRs for CRC were 0.91 (95% CI 0.74-1.12) for
periodontal disease, and 1.22 (95% CI 0.91-1.63) when limited to moderate to
severe periodontal disease. The results were not modified by smoking status, body
mass index or alcohol consumption. Women with fewer teeth, possibly moderate or
severe periodontal disease, might be at a modest increased risk of developing
CRC, suggesting a potential role of oral health in colorectal carcinogenesis.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common solid tumors worldwide, often
associated with inflammation. The microbes in the human intestine have a key role
in inflammations and CRC. Chitotriose renders growth advantage to some bacteria, 
especially some pathogens, and thus has a role in inflammations. The enzyme
chitotriosidase, encoded by the CHIT1 gene of the host, may degrade chitotriose
with different efficiencies depending on the alleles. We sequenced the CHIT1 gene
for 320 Chinese Han CRC patients and 404 normal controls, and focused on
variations rs61745299 and rs35920428 within the CHIT1 gene for their possible
roles in CRC. Statistical analyses were conducted using Chi-Square Tests as
implemented in SPSS (version 19.0). Multiple sequence alignment was conducted
using the Vector NTI, and protein expression levels were analyzed by western
blotting. The two variations, rs61745299 and rs35920428 within the CDS region of 
CHIT1 gene, were associated with the risk of CRC (both with P values < 0.001).
Western blotting analysis showed that the variations increased the expression
levels of the CHIT1 and C-reaction protein genes in the cancer tissue. We
conclude that the two variations of CHIT1, rs61745299 and rs35920428, increase
expression of the gene and are associated with CRC in Chinese Han populations.

IL-33 regulates the IgA-microbiota axis to restrain IL-1α-dependent colitis and
tumorigenesis.

Malik A, Sharma D, Zhu Q, Karki R, Guy CS, Vogel P, Kanneganti TD.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affect over 5 million individuals in the
industrialized world, with an increasing incidence rate worldwide. IBD also
predisposes affected individuals to development of colorectal cancer, which is a 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in adults. Mutations in genes encoding
molecules in the IL-33 signaling pathway are associated with colitis and
colitis-associated cancer (CAC), but how IL-33 modulates gut homeostasis is
unclear. Here, we have shown that Il33-deficient mice are highly susceptible to
colitis and CAC. Mechanistically, we observed that IL-33 promoted IgA production 
from B cells, which is important for maintaining microbial homeostasis in the
intestine. Il33-deficient mice developed a dysbiotic microbiota that was
characterized by increased levels of mucolytic and colitogenic bacteria. In
response to chemically induced colitis, this microbial landscape promoted the
release of IL-1α, which acted as a critical driver of colitis and CAC.
Consequently, reconstitution of symbiotic microbiota or IL-1α ablation markedly
ameliorated colitis susceptibility in Il33-deficient animals. Our results
demonstrate that IL-33 promotes IgA production to maintain gut microbial
homoeostasis and restrain IL-1α-dependent colitis and CAC. This study therefore
highlights modulation of IL-33, IgA, IL-1α, and the microbiota as a potential
therapeutic approach in the treatment of IBD and CAC.

Many studies have demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in healthy
and disease states. However, establishing the causality of host-microbiota
interactions in humans is still challenging. Here, we describe a novel
experimental system to define the transcriptional response induced by the
microbiota in human cells and to shed light on the molecular mechanisms
underlying host-gut microbiota interactions. In primary human colonic epithelial 
cells, we identified over 6,000 genes that change expression at various time
points following co-culturing with the gut microbiota of a healthy individual.
Among the differentially expressed genes we found a 1.8-fold enrichment of genes 
associated with diseases that have been previously linked to the microbiome, such
as obesity and colorectal cancer. In addition, our experimental system allowed us
to identify 87 host SNPs that show allele-specific expression in 69 genes.
Furthermore, for 12 SNPs in 12 different genes, allele-specific expression is
conditional on the exposure to the microbiota. Of these 12 genes, eight have been
associated with diseases linked to the gut microbiota, specifically colorectal
cancer, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Our study demonstrates a scalable approach
to study host-gut microbiota interactions and can be used to identify putative
mechanisms for the interplay between host genetics and microbiota in health and
disease.

The significance of diet for disease prevention has long been recognised. Dietary
recommendations have therefore been integrated in health promotion messages.
Gastrointestinal functioning is essential for the digestion of nutrients.
Oxidative stress has been observed in patients with constipation, as well as in
those with colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease and other chronic illnesses 
associated with constipation. The coexistence of colorectal neoplasia and
coronary artery disease has been incriminated for exposure to common risk factors
associated with increased oxidative stress. It was recently demonstrated that
bowel movement frequency is inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality.
The aim of the present study was to review the relevant literature in light of
these findings. It was concluded that suboptimal functioning of the large bowel
may contribute to oxidative stress and, therefore, to increased mortality. Bowel 
movement frequency may represent a simple quantifiable indicator of adequate
colonic function and it is dependent on diet, exercise and other lifestyle
factors, but also on individual characteristics, including colonic microbiota.
Future health promotion actions may improve the prevention of a number of
diseases by advocating lifestyle personalisation for assuring optimal intestinal 
functioning.

Obesity is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). Our previous
study indicated that obesity increases activity of the pro-tumorigenic
Wnt-signaling. Presently, we sought to further advance our understanding of the
mechanisms by which obesity promotes CRC by examining associations between
microbiome, inflammation and Wnt-signaling in Apc+/1638N mice whose obesity was
induced by one of two modalities, diet- or genetically-induced obesity. Three
groups were employed: Apc+/1638NLepr+/+ fed a low fat diet (10% fat),
Apc+/1638NLepr+/+ fed a high fat diet (60% fat, diet-induced obesity), and
Apc+/1638NLeprdb/db fed a low fat diet (genetically-induced obesity). All animals
received diets for 16 weeks from 8 to 24 weeks of age. The abundance of 19 bowel 
cancer-associated bacterial taxa were examined by real-time PCR. The abundance of
Turicibacter and Desulfovibrio decreased, but F. prausnitizii increased, in
diet-induced obese mice (p < 0.05). In contrast, in genetically-induced obese
mice, Bifidobacterium, A. muciniphila and E. rectale decreased, but
Peptostrptococcus, and E. coli increased (p < 0.05). Both diet- and
genetically-induced obesity altered the expression of genes involved in bacterial
recognition (MyD88) and increased inflammation as indicated by elevated levels of
cytokines (IFNγ and TNF-α for genetically-induced obesity, and IL-6 for
diet-induced obesity). The elevated inflammation was associated with altered
expression of genes that are integral components of the Wnt-signaling cascade in 
a fashion indicating its activation. These findings demonstrate that the
composition of the small intestinal microbiome is affected differently in diet-
and genetically-induced obesity, but both are associated with elevated intestinal
inflammation and alterations of the Wnt pathway towards enhancing tumorigenesis.

Purpose: Gut microbiota have been implicated in the development of colorectal
cancer. We evaluated the utility of fecal bacterial marker candidates identified 
by our metagenome sequencing analysis for colorectal cancer
diagnosis.Experimental Design: Subjects (total 439; 203 colorectal cancer and 236
healthy subjects) from two independent Asian cohorts were included. Probe-based
duplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were established for the quantification of 
bacterial marker candidates.Results: Candidates identified by metagenome
sequencing, including Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Bacteroides clarus (Bc),
Roseburia intestinalis (Ri), Clostridium hathewayi (Ch), and one undefined
species (labeled as m7), were examined in fecal samples of 203 colorectal cancer 
patients and 236 healthy controls by duplex-qPCR. Strong positive correlations
were demonstrated between the quantification of each candidate by our qPCR assays
and metagenomics approach (r = 0.801-0.934, all P < 0.0001). Fn was significantly
more abundant in colorectal cancer than controls (P < 0.0001), with AUROC of
0.868 (P < 0.0001). At the best cut-off value maximizing sum of sensitivity and
specificity, Fn discriminated colorectal cancer from controls with a sensitivity 
of 77.7%, and specificity of 79.5% in cohort I. A simple linear combination of
four bacteria (Fn + Ch + m7-Bc) showed an improved diagnostic ability compared
with Fn alone (AUROC = 0.886, P < 0.0001) in cohort I. These findings were
further confirmed in an independent cohort II. In particular, improved diagnostic
performances of Fn alone (sensitivity 92.8%, specificity 79.8%) and four bacteria
(sensitivity 92.8%, specificity 81.5%) were achieved in combination with fecal
immunochemical testing for the detection of colorectal cancer.Conclusions:
Stool-based colorectal cancer-associated bacteria can serve as novel noninvasive 
diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 23(8); 2061-70.

BACKGROUND: Adenomatous polyps are the most common precursor to colorectal
cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. We
sought to learn more about early events of carcinogenesis by investigating shifts
in the gut microbiota of patients with adenomas.
METHODS: We analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequences from the fecal microbiota of
patients with adenomas (n = 233) and without (n = 547).
RESULTS: Multiple taxa were significantly more abundant in patients with
adenomas, including Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, proinflammatory bacteria in the
genus Mogibacterium, and multiple Bacteroidetes species. Patients without
adenomas had greater abundances of Veillonella, Firmicutes (Order Clostridia),
and Actinobacteria (family Bifidobacteriales). Our findings were consistent with 
previously reported shifts in the gut microbiota of colorectal cancer patients.
Importantly, the altered adenoma profile is predicted to increase primary and
secondary bile acid production, as well as starch, sucrose, lipid, and
phenylpropanoid metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: These data hint that increased sugar, protein, and lipid metabolism 
along with increased bile acid production could promote a colonic environment
that supports the growth of bile-tolerant microbes such as Bilophilia and
Desulfovibrio In turn, these microbes may produce genotoxic or inflammatory
metabolites such as H2S and secondary bile acids, which could play a role in
catalyzing adenoma development and eventually colorectal cancer.
IMPACT: This study suggests a plausible biological mechanism to explain the links
between shifts in the microbiota and colorectal cancer. This represents a first
step toward resolving the complex interactions that shape the adenoma-carcinoma
sequence of colorectal cancer and may facilitate personalized therapeutics
focused on the microbiota. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(1); 85-94. ©2016

BACKGROUND & AIMS: De novo synthesis of guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-fucose, a
substrate for fucosylglycans, requires sequential reactions mediated by
GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMDS) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose
3,5-epimerase-4-reductase (FX or tissue specific transplantation antigen P35B
[TSTA3]). GMDS deletions and mutations are found in 6%-13% of colorectal cancers;
these mostly affect the ascending and transverse colon. We investigated whether a
lack of fucosylation consequent to loss of GDP-fucose synthesis contributes to
colon carcinogenesis.
METHODS: FX deficiency and GMDS deletion produce the same biochemical phenotype
of GDP-fucose deficiency. We studied a mouse model of fucosylation deficiency
(Fx-/- mice) and mice with the full-length Fx gene (controls). Mice were placed
on standard chow or fucose-containing diet (equivalent to a control fucosylglycan
phenotype). Colon tissues were collected and analyzed histologically or by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure cytokine levels; T cells also were 
collected and analyzed. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16s ribosomal RNA
sequencing. Mucosal barrier function was measured by uptake of fluorescent
dextran. We transplanted bone marrow cells from Fx-/- or control mice (Ly5.2)
into irradiated 8-week-old Fx-/- or control mice (Ly5.1). We performed
immunohistochemical analyses for expression of Notch and the hes family bHLH
transcription factor (HES1) in colon tissues from mice and a panel of 60 human
colorectal cancer specimens (27 left-sided, 33 right-sided).
RESULTS: Fx-/- mice developed colitis and serrated-like lesions. The intestinal
pathology of Fx-/- mice was reversed by addition of fucose to the diet, which
restored fucosylation via a salvage pathway. In the absence of fucosylation,
dysplasia appeared and progressed to adenocarcinoma in up to 40% of mice,
affecting mainly the right colon and cecum. Notch was not activated in Fx-/- mice
fed standard chow, leading to decreased expression of its target Hes1.
Fucosylation deficiency altered the composition of the fecal microbiota, reduced 
mucosal barrier function, and altered epithelial proliferation marked by Ki67.
Fx-/- mice receiving control bone marrow cells had intestinal inflammation and
dysplasia, and reduced expression of cytokines produced by cytotoxic T cells.
Human sessile serrated adenomas and right-sided colorectal tumors with epigenetic
loss of MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) had lost or had lower levels of HES1 than other
colorectal tumor types or nontumor tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: In mice, fucosylation deficiency leads to colitis and
adenocarcinoma, loss of Notch activation, and down-regulation of Hes1. HES1 loss 
correlates with the development of human right-sided colorectal tumors with
epigenetic loss of MLH1. These findings indicate that carcinogenesis in a subset 
of colon cancer is consequent to a molecular mechanism driven by fucosylation
deficiency and/or HES1-loss.

Although all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is a key regulator of intestinal
immunity, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. We found that mice with
colitis-associated CRC had a marked deficiency in colonic atRA due to alterations
in atRA metabolism mediated by microbiota-induced intestinal inflammation. Human 
ulcerative colitis (UC), UC-associated CRC, and sporadic CRC specimens have
similar alterations in atRA metabolic enzymes, consistent with reduced colonic
atRA. Inhibition of atRA signaling promoted tumorigenesis, whereas atRA
supplementation reduced tumor burden. The benefit of atRA treatment was mediated 
by cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, which were activated due to MHCI upregulation on
tumor cells. Consistent with these findings, increased colonic expression of the 
atRA-catabolizing enzyme, CYP26A1, correlated with reduced frequencies of tumoral
cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells and with worse disease prognosis in human CRC. These
results reveal a mechanism by which microbiota drive colon carcinogenesis and
highlight atRA metabolism as a therapeutic target for CRC.

Proteomic indicators of oxidation and hydration state in colorectal cancer.

Dick JM(1).

New integrative approaches are needed to harness the potential of rapidly growing
datasets of protein expression and microbial community composition in colorectal 
cancer. Chemical and thermodynamic models offer theoretical tools to describe
populations of biomacromolecules and their relative potential for formation in
different microenvironmental conditions. The average oxidation state of carbon (Z
C) can be calculated as an elemental ratio from the chemical formulas of
proteins, and water demand per residue ([Formula: see text]) is computed by
writing the overall formation reactions of proteins from basis species. Using
results reported in proteomic studies of clinical samples, many datasets exhibit 
higher mean Z C or [Formula: see text] of proteins in carcinoma or adenoma
compared to normal tissue. In contrast, average protein compositions in bacterial
genomes often have lower Z C for bacteria enriched in fecal samples from cancer
patients compared to healthy donors. In thermodynamic calculations, the potential
for formation of the cancer-related proteins is energetically favored by changes 
in the chemical activity of H2O and fugacity of O2 that reflect the compositional
differences. The compositional analysis suggests that a systematic change in
chemical composition is an essential feature of cancer proteomes, and the
thermodynamic descriptions show that the observed proteomic transformations in
host tissue could be promoted by relatively high microenvironmental oxidation and
hydration states.

PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer is a worldwide cancer with rising annual incidence.
Inflammation is a well-known cause of colorectal cancer carcinogenesis. Metabolic
inflammation (metaflammation) and altered gut microbiota (dysbiosis) have
contributed to colorectal cancer. Chemoprevention is an important strategy to
reduce cancer-related mortality. Recently, various polypharmacologic molecules
that dually inhibit histone deacetylases (HDAC) and other therapeutic targets
have been developed.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Prevention for colitis was examined by dextran sodium
sulfate (DSS) mouse models. Prevention for colorectal cancer was examined by
azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) mouse models. Immunohistochemical
staining was utilized to analyze the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils 
and COX-II expression in mouse tissue specimens. The endotoxin activity was
evaluated by Endotoxin Activity Assay Kit.
RESULTS: We synthesized a statin hydroxamate that simultaneously inhibited HDAC
and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR). Its preventive effect
on colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer in mouse models was examined.
Oral administration of this statin hydroxamate could prevent acute inflammation
in the DSS-induced colitis and AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer with superior
activity than the combination of lovastatin and SAHA. It also reduced
proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, expression of COX-II, and cyclin D1 in
inflammation and tumor tissues, as well as decreasing the infiltration of
macrophages and neutrophils in tumor-surrounding regions. Stemness of colorectal 
cancer and the release of endotoxin in AOM/DSS mouse models were also attenuated 
by this small molecule.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the polypharmacological HDAC inhibitor 
has promising effect on the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer, and serum
endotoxin level might serve as a potential biomarker for its chemoprevention.

Comment in
    Cell Host Microbe. 2016 Aug 10;20(2):125-6.

Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with colorectal cancer and promotes colonic
tumor formation in preclinical models. However, fusobacteria are core members of 
the human oral microbiome and less prevalent in the healthy gut, raising
questions about how fusobacteria localize to CRC. We identify a host
polysaccharide and fusobacterial lectin that explicates fusobacteria abundance in
CRC. Gal-GalNAc, which is overexpressed in CRC, is recognized by fusobacterial
Fap2, which functions as a Gal-GalNAc lectin. F. nucleatum binding to clinical
adenocarcinomas correlates with Gal-GalNAc expression and is reduced upon
O-glycanase treatment. Clinical fusobacteria strains naturally lacking Fap2 or
inactivated Fap2 mutants show reduced binding to Gal-GalNAc-expressing CRC cells 
and established CRCs in mice. Additionally, intravenously injected F. nucleatum
localizes to mouse tumor tissues in a Fap2-dependent manner, suggesting that
fusobacteria use a hematogenous route to reach colon adenocarcinomas. Thus,
targeting F. nucleatum Fap2 or host epithelial Gal-GalNAc may reduce fusobacteria
potentiation of CRC.

BACKGROUND: Reduced microbial diversity in human intestines has been implicated
in various conditions such as diabetes, colorectal cancer, and inflammatory bowel
disease. The role of physical fitness in the context of human intestinal
microbiota is currently not known. We used high-throughput sequencing to analyze 
fecal microbiota of 39 healthy participants with similar age, BMI, and diets but 
with varying cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Fecal short-chain fatty acids were
analyzed using gas chromatography.
RESULTS: We showed that peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), the gold standard measure
of cardiorespiratory fitness, can account for more than 20 % of the variation in 
taxonomic richness, after accounting for all other factors, including diet. While
VO2peak did not explain variation in beta diversity, it did play a significant
role in explaining variation in the microbiomes' predicted metagenomic functions,
aligning positively with genes related to bacterial chemotaxis, motility, and
fatty acid biosynthesis. These predicted functions were supported by measured
increases in production of fecal butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid associated
with improved gut health, amongst physically fit participants. We also identified
increased abundances of key butyrate-producing taxa (Clostridiales, Roseburia,
Lachnospiraceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae) amongst these individuals, which likely
contributed to the observed increases in butyrate levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study show that cardiorespiratory fitness is
correlated with increased microbial diversity in healthy humans and that the
associated changes are anchored around a set of functional cores rather than
specific taxa. The microbial profiles of fit individuals favor the production of 
butyrate. As increased microbiota diversity and butyrate production is associated
with overall host health, our findings warrant the use of exercise prescription
as an adjuvant therapy in combating dysbiosis-associated diseases.

SCOPE: Heat-stabilized rice bran (SRB) and cooked navy bean powder (NBP) contain 
a variety of phytochemicals that are fermented by colonic microbiota and may
influence intestinal health. Dietary interventions with these foods should be
explored for modulating colorectal cancer risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized-controlled pilot clinical trial investigated
the effects of eating SRB (30 g/day) or cooked navy bean powder (35 g/day) on gut
microbiota and metabolites (NCT01929122). Twenty-nine overweight/obese volunteers
with a prior history of colorectal cancer consumed a study-provided meal and
snack daily for 28 days. Volunteers receiving SRB or NBP showed increased gut
bacterial diversity and altered gut microbial composition at 28 days compared to 
baseline. Supplementation with SRB or NBP increased total dietary fiber intake
similarly, yet only rice bran intake led to a decreased Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes 
ratio and increased SCFA (propionate and acetate) in stool after 14 days but not 
at 28 days.
CONCLUSION: These findings support modulation of gut microbiota and fermentation 
byproducts by SRB and suggest that foods with similar ability to increase dietary
fiber intake may not have equal effects on gut microbiota and microbial
metabolism.

Inflammatory bowel disease is a risk factor for colorectal cancer initiation and 
development. In this study, the effects of American ginseng on chemically induced
colitis and colon carcinogenesis were evaluated using an azoxymethane
(AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model. During the acute phase on day 15,
the oral administration of ginseng (15 and 30 mg/kg/day) significantly suppressed
AOM/DSS-induced colitis, as demonstrated by the disease activity index and colon 
tissue histology. During the chronic phase in week 13, AOM/DSS-induced tumor
multiplicity was significantly suppressed by ginseng. Ginseng significantly
attenuated the increase of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL1α, IL1β, IL6,
G-CSF, and GM-CSF. Serum metabolomics data in the PCA plots showed good
separation between the AOM/DSS model and ginseng-treated mice, and the most
important endogenous metabolite changes were identified. The 16S rRNA data showed
that after AOM/DSS, the microbiome community in the model group was obviously
changed, and ginseng inhibited these changes. Fecal metabolomics analysis
supported these findings. In conclusion, oral ginseng significantly decreased
AOM/DSS-induced colitis and colon carcinogenesis by inhibiting inflammatory
cytokines and restoring the metabolomics and microbiota profiles accordingly.

Colorectal tumors arise with genomic and epigenomic alterations through
interactions between neoplastic cells, immune cells, and microbiota that vary
along the proximal to distal axis of colorectum. Long interspersed nucleotide
element-1 (LINE-1) hypomethylation in colorectal cancer has been associated with 
worse clinical outcome. Utilizing 1,317 colon and rectal carcinoma cases in two
U.S.-nationwide prospective cohort studies, we examined patient survival
according to LINE-1 methylation level stratified by tumor location. Cox
proportional hazards model was used to assess a statistical interaction between
LINE-1 methylation level and tumor location in colorectal cancer-specific
mortality analysis, controlling for potential confounders including
microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and KRAS, BRAF, and 
PIK3CA mutations. A statistically significant interaction was found between
LINE-1 methylation level and tumor location in colorectal cancer-specific
mortality analysis (Pinteraction = 0.011). The association of LINE-1
hypomethylation with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality was stronger in 
proximal colon cancers (multivariable hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.21 to 2.28) than in distal colon cancers (multivariable HR,
1.18; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.72) or rectal cancers (multivariable HR, 0.87; 95% CI,
0.57 to 1.34). Our data suggest the interactive effect of LINE-1 methylation
level and colorectal cancer location on clinical outcome.

BACKGROUND: Structural change in the gut microbiota is implicated in cancer. The 
beneficial modulation of the microbiota composition with probiotics and
prebiotics prevents diseases.
AIM: We investigated the effect of oligofructose-maltodextrin-enriched
Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacteria bifidum, and Bifidobacteria infantum
(LBB), on the gut microbiota composition and progression of colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were acclimatized, given ampicillin (75 mg/kg), and 
treated as follows; GCO: normal control; GPR: LBB only; GPC: LBB+
1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH); and GCA: DMH only (cancer control). 
16S V4 Pyrosequencing for gut microbiota analysis, tumor studies, and the
expression of MUC2, ZO-1, occludin, TLR2, TLR4, caspase 3, COX-2, and β-catenin
were conducted at the end of experiment.
RESULTS: Probiotic LBB treatment altered the gut microbiota. The relative
abundance of genera Pseudomonas, Congregibacter, Clostridium, Candidactus spp.,
Phaeobacter, Escherichia, Helicobacter, and HTCC was decreased (P < 0.05), but
the genus Lactobacillus increased (P < 0.05), in LBB treatment than in cancer
control. The altered gut microbiota was associated with decreased tumor incidence
(80 % in GPC vs. 100 % in GCA, P = 0.0001), tumor volume (GPC 84.23 (42.75-188.4)
mm(3) vs. GCA 243 (175.5-344.5) mm(3), P < 0.0001) and tumor multiplicity/count
(GPC 2.92 ± 0.26 vs. GCA 6.27 ± 0.41; P < 0.0001). The expression of MUC2, ZO-1, 
occludin, and TLR2 was increased, but expression of TLR4, caspase 3, Cox-2, and
β-catenin was decreased by LBB treatment than in cancer control GCA (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Administration of LBB modulates the gut microbiota and reduces colon 
cancer development by decreasing tumor incidence, multiplicity/count, and volume 
via enhanced TLR2-improved gut mucosa epithelial barrier integrity and
suppression of apoptosis and inflammation.

Evidences have shown that dysbiosis could promote the progression of colorectal
cancer (CRC). However, the association of dysbiosis and prognosis of CRC is
barely investigated. Therefore, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to
determine differences in microbiota among tumor tissues of different prognosis
and found that Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis were more
abundant in worse prognosis groups, while Faecalibacterium prausnitzii displayed 
higher abundance in survival group. To further explore the prognostic value of
the found bacteria, Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression analyses were
used and the results exhibited that high abundance of F. nucleatum and B.
fragilis were independent indicators of poor patient's survival. Besides, the
expression of major inflammatory mediator were analyzed using PCR and western
blot methods, and it turned out that high abundance of F. nucleatum was
associated with increased expression of TNF-α, β-catenin and NF-κB, while COX-2, 
MMP-9 and NF-κB were positively related with high B. fragilis level, and high
level of F. prausnitzii showed lower expression of β-catenin, MMP-9 and NF-κB.
Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that KRAS and BRAF expression
were prominent in F. nucleatum and B. fragilis high abundance group, while MLH1
showed lower expression. In conclusion, F. nucleatum, B. fragilis and F.
prausnitzii can be identified as useful prognostic biomarkers for CRC, and
dysbiosis might worsen the patients' prognosis by up-regulating gut inflammation 
level.

Obesity is a significant risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the
relative contribution of high-fat (HF) consumption and excess adiposity remains
unclear. It is becoming apparent that obesity perturbs both the intestinal
microbiome and metabolome, and each has the potential to induce protumorigenic
changes in the epithelial transcriptome. The physiological consequences and the
degree to which these different biologic systems interact remain poorly defined. 
To understand the mechanisms by which obesity drives colonic tumorigenesis, we
profiled the colonic epithelial transcriptome of HF-fed and genetically obese
(DbDb) mice with a genetic predisposition to intestinal tumorigenesis
(Apc(1638N)); 266 and 584 genes were differentially expressed in the colonic
mucosa of HF and DbDb mice, respectively. These genes mapped to pathways involved
in immune function, and cellular proliferation and cancer. Furthermore, Akt was
central within the networks of interacting genes identified in both gene sets.
Regression analyses of coexpressed genes with the abundance of bacterial taxa
identified three taxa, previously correlated with tumor burden, to be
significantly correlated with a gene module enriched for Akt-related genes.
Similarly, regression of coexpressed genes with metabolites found that adenosine,
which was negatively associated with inflammatory markers and tumor burden, was
also correlated with a gene module enriched with Akt regulators. Our findings
provide evidence that HF consumption and excess adiposity result in changes in
the colonic transcriptome that, although distinct, both appear to converge on Akt
signaling. Such changes could be mediated by alterations in the colonic
microbiome and metabolome.

There is growing evidence that individuals with colonic adenomas and carcinomas
harbor a distinct microbiota. Alterations to the gut microbiota may allow the
outgrowth of bacterial populations that induce genomic mutations or exacerbate
tumor-promoting inflammation. In addition, it is likely that the loss of key
bacterial populations may result in the loss of protective functions that are
normally provided by the microbiota. We explored the role of the gut microbiota
in colon tumorigenesis by using an inflammation-based murine model. We observed
that perturbing the microbiota with different combinations of antibiotics reduced
the number of tumors at the end of the model. Using the random forest machine
learning algorithm, we successfully modeled the number of tumors that developed
over the course of the model on the basis of the initial composition of the
microbiota. The timing of antibiotic treatment was an important determinant of
tumor outcome, as colon tumorigenesis was arrested by the use of antibiotics
during the early inflammation period of the murine model. Together, these results
indicate that it is possible to predict colon tumorigenesis on the basis of the
composition of the microbiota and that altering the gut microbiota can alter the 
course of tumorigenesis. IMPORTANCE Mounting evidence indicates that alterations 
to the gut microbiota, the complex community of bacteria that inhabits the
gastrointestinal tract, are strongly associated with the development of
colorectal cancer. We used antibiotic perturbations to a murine model of
inflammation-driven colon cancer to generate eight starting communities that
resulted in various severities of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we were able to
quantitatively predict the final number of tumors on the basis of the initial
composition of the gut microbiota. These results further bolster the evidence
that the gut microbiota is involved in mediating the development of colorectal
cancer. As a final proof of principle, we showed that perturbing the gut
microbiota in the midst of tumorigenesis could halt the formation of additional
tumors. Together, alteration of the gut microbiota may be a useful therapeutic
approach to preventing and altering the trajectory of colorectal cancer.

Chronic consumption of excess ethanol increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
The pathogenesis of ethanol-related colorectal cancer (ER-CRC) is thought to be
partly mediated by gut microbes. Specifically, bacteria in the colon and rectum
convert ethanol to acetaldehyde (AcH), which is carcinogenic. However, the
effects of chronic ethanol consumption on the human gut microbiome are poorly
understood, and the role of gut microbes in the proposed AcH-mediated
pathogenesis of ER-CRC remains to be elaborated. Here we analyse and compare the 
gut microbiota structures of non-alcoholics and alcoholics. The gut microbiotas
of alcoholics were diminished in dominant obligate anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides
and Ruminococcus) and enriched in Streptococcus and other minor species. This
alteration might be exacerbated by habitual smoking. These observations could at 
least partly be explained by the susceptibility of obligate anaerobes to reactive
oxygen species, which are increased by chronic exposure of the gut mucosa to
ethanol. The AcH productivity from ethanol was much lower in the faeces of
alcoholic patients than in faeces of non-alcoholic subjects. The faecal phenotype
of the alcoholics could be rationalised based on their gut microbiota structures 
and the ability of gut bacteria to accumulate AcH from ethanol.

BACKGROUND: A pro-inflammatory gut microbiota was described in both Parkinson's
disease and colorectal cancer (CRC) and recently α-synuclein was demonstrated in 
the enteric nervous system. We sought to evaluate the association between
Parkinson's disease and CRC.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study using a large primary-care
database. Cases were defined as all individuals with CRC. Up to 4 controls were
matched with each case based on age, sex, practice-site and duration of
follow-up. The primary exposure of interest was diagnosis of Parkinson's disease 
prior to CRC as well as disease duration, and Parkinson's specific therapies. The
primary analysis was a conditional logistic-regression to estimate odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI).
RESULTS: The study included 22,093 CRC cases and 85,833 matched controls. Past
medical history of Parkinson's disease >1 year before index-date was associated
with lower CRC risk (OR 0.74, 95%CI 0.59-0.94). The inverse association was more 
prominent among females compared to males (0.64, 95%CI 0.42-0.96 and 0.8, 95%CI
0.60-1.07, respectively). While patients who received no therapy or therapy with 
dopamine agonists had a non-significant decrease in cancer risk, patients who
were treated with dopamine had a non-significant elevated cancer risk.
CONCLUSION: Parkinson's disease is inversely associated with CRC risk.

Combination Therapy of Lactobacillus plantarum Supernatant and 5-Fluouracil
Increases Chemosensitivity in Colorectal Cancer Cells.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world. Although
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is the representative chemotherapy drug for colorectal
cancer, it has therapeutic limits due to its chemoresistant characteristics.
Colorectal cancer cells can develop into cancer stem cells (CSCs) with
self-renewal potential, thereby causing malignant tumors. The human
gastrointestinal tract contains a complex gut microbiota that is essential for
the host's homeostasis. Recently, many studies have reported correlations between
gut flora and the onset, progression, and treatment of CRC. The present study
confirms that the most representative symbiotic bacteria in humans, Lactobacillus
plantarum (LP) supernatant (SN), selectively inhibit the characteristics of
5-FU-resistant colorectal cancer cells (HT-29 and HCT- 116). LP SN inhibited the 
expression of the specific markers CD44, 133, 166, and ALDH1 of CSCs. The
combination therapy of LP SN and 5-FU inhibited the survival of CRCs and led to
cell death by inducing caspase-3 activity. The combination therapy of LP SN and
5-FU induced an anticancer mechanism by inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
of chemoresistant CRC cells, and reducing the formation and size of
colonospheres. In conclusion, our results show that LP SN can enhance the
therapeutic effect of 5-FU for colon cancer, and reduce colorectal cancer
stem-like cells by reversing the development of resistance to anticancer drugs.
This implies that probiotic substances may be useful therapeutic alternatives as 
biotherapeutics for chemoresistant CRC.

Foods naturally high in dietary fiber are generally considered to protect against
development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the intrinsic effect of dietary 
fiber on intestinal carcinogenesis is unclear. We used azoxymethane (AOM) treated
A/J Min/+ mice, which developed a significantly higher tumor load in the colon
than in the small intestine, to compare the effects of dietary inulin (IN),
cellulose (CE) or brewers spent grain (BSG) on intestinal tumorigenesis and cecal
microbiota. Each fiber was tested at two dose levels, 5% and 15% (w/w) content of
the AIN-93M diet. The microbiota was investigated by next-generation sequencing
of the 16S rRNA gene (V4). We found that mice fed IN had approximately 50% lower 
colonic tumor load than mice fed CE or BSG (p<0.001). Surprisingly, all three
types of fiber caused a dose dependent increase of colonic tumor load (p<0.001). 
The small intestinal tumor load was not affected by the dietary fiber
interventions. Mice fed IN had a lower bacterial diversity than mice fed CE or
BSG. The Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio was significantly (p = 0.003) different
between the three fiber diets with a higher mean value in IN fed mice compared
with BSG and CE. We also found a relation between microbiota and the colonic
tumor load, where many of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to low
tumor load were significantly enriched in mice fed IN. Among the OTUs related to 
low tumor load were bacteria affiliated with the Bacteroides genus. These results
suggest that type of dietary fiber may play a role in the development of CRC, and
that the suppressive effect of IN on colonic tumorigenesis is associated with
profound changes in the cecal microbiota profile.

Recent reports have suggested that the gut microbiota is involved in the
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The composition of gut microbiota in CRC 
precursors has not been adequately described. To characterize the structure of
adherent microbiota in this disease, we conducted pyrosequencing-based analysis
of 16S rRNA genes to determine the bacterial profile of normal colons (healthy
controls) and colorectal adenomas (CRC precursors). Adenoma mucosal biopsy
samples and adjacent normal colonic mucosa from 31 patients with adenomas and 20 
healthy volunteers were profiled using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Principal
coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed structural segregation between colorectal
adenomatous tissue and control tissue. Alpha diversity estimations revealed
higher microbiota diversity in samples from patients with adenomas. Taxonomic
analysis illustrated that abundance of eight phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria,
Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Candidate-division
TM7, and Tenericutes) was significantly different. In addition, Lactococcus and
Pseudomonas were enriched in preneoplastic tissue, whereas Enterococcus,
Bacillus, and Solibacillus were reduced. However, both PCoA and cluster tree
analyses showed similar microbiota structure between adenomatous and adjacent
non-adenoma tissues. These present findings provide preliminary experimental
evidence supporting that colorectal preneoplastic lesion may be the most
important factor leading to alterations in bacterial community composition.

BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum, a well studied bacterium in periodontal
diseases, appendicitis, gingivitis, osteomyelitis and pregnancy complications has
recently gained attention due to its association with colorectal cancer (CRC)
progression. Treatment with berberine was shown to reverse F. nucleatum-induced
CRC progression in mice by balancing the growth of opportunistic pathogens in
tumor microenvironment. Intestinal microbiota imbalance and the infections caused
by F. nucleatum might be regulated by therapeutic intervention. Hence, we aimed
to predict drug target proteins in F. nucleatum, through subtractive genomics
approach and host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (HP-PPIs). We also
carried out enrichment analysis of host interacting partners to hypothesize the
possible mechanisms involved in CRC progression due to F. nucleatum.
RESULTS: In subtractive genomics approach, the essential, virulence and
resistance related proteins were retrieved from RefSeq proteome of F. nucleatum
by searching against Database of Essential Genes (DEG), Virulence Factor Database
(VFDB) and Antibiotic Resistance Gene-ANNOTation (ARG-ANNOT) tool respectively. A
subsequent hierarchical screening to identify non-human homologous, metabolic
pathway-independent/pathway-specific and druggable proteins resulted in eight
pathway-independent and 27 pathway-specific druggable targets. Co-aggregation of 
F. nucleatum with host induces proinflammatory gene expression thereby
potentiates tumorigenesis. Hence, proteins from IBDsite, a database for
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research and those involved in colorectal
adenocarcinoma as interpreted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were retrieved 
to predict drug targets based on HP-PPIs with F. nucleatum proteome. Prediction
of HP-PPIs exhibited 186 interactions contributed by 103 host and 76 bacterial
proteins. Bacterial interacting partners were accounted as putative targets. And 
enrichment analysis of host interacting partners showed statistically enriched
terms that were in positive correlation with CRC, atherosclerosis,
cardiovascular, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's and other diseases.
CONCLUSION: Subtractive genomics analysis provided a set of target proteins
suggested to be indispensable for survival and pathogenicity of F. nucleatum.
These target proteins might be considered for designing potent inhibitors to
abrogate F. nucleatum infections. From enrichment analysis, it was hypothesized
that F. nucleatum infection might enhance CRC progression by simultaneously
regulating multiple signaling cascades which could lead to up-regulation of
proinflammatory responses, oncogenes, modulation of host immune defense mechanism
and suppression of DNA repair system.

Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota affects colorectal cancer
development, but previous studies have varied in population, technical methods,
and associations with cancer. Understanding these variations is needed for
comparisons and for potential pooling across studies. Therefore, we performed
whole-genome shotgun sequencing on fecal samples from 52 pre-treatment colorectal
cancer cases and 52 matched controls from Washington, DC. We compared findings
from a previously published 16S rRNA study to the metagenomics-derived taxonomy
within the same population. In addition, metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and
pathways in the Washington, DC cases and controls were compared to cases and
controls recruited in France whose specimens were processed using the same
platform. Associations between the presence of fecal Fusobacteria, Fusobacterium,
and Porphyromonas with colorectal cancer detected by 16S rRNA were reproduced by 
metagenomics, whereas higher relative abundance of Clostridia in cancer cases
based on 16S rRNA was merely borderline based on metagenomics. This demonstrated 
that within the same sample set, most, but not all taxonomic associations were
seen with both methods. Considering significant cancer associations with the
relative abundance of genes, modules, and pathways in a recently published French
metagenomics dataset, statistically significant associations in the Washington,
DC population were detected for four out of 10 genes, three out of nine modules, 
and seven out of 17 pathways. In total, colorectal cancer status in the
Washington, DC study was associated with 39% of the metagenome-predicted genes,
modules, and pathways identified in the French study. More within and between
population comparisons are needed to identify sources of variation and disease
associations that can be reproduced despite these variations. Future studies
should have larger sample sizes or pool data across studies to have sufficient
power to detect associations that are reproducible and significant after
correction for multiple testing.

    Cancer Cell. 2016 May 9;29(5):615-7.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with loss of epithelial barrier integrity, 
which facilitates the interaction of the immunological microenvironment with the 
luminal microbiome, eliciting tumor-supportive inflammation. An important
regulator of intestinal inflammatory responses is IRAK-M, a negative regulator of
TLR signaling. Here we investigate the compartment-specific impact of IRAK-M on
colorectal carcinogenesis using a mouse model. We demonstrate that IRAK-M is
expressed in tumor cells due to combined TLR and Wnt activation. Tumor
cell-intrinsic IRAK-M is responsible for regulation of microbial colonization of 
tumors and STAT3 protein stability in tumor cells, leading to tumor cell
proliferation. IRAK-M expression in human CRCs is associated with poor prognosis.
These results suggest that IRAK-M may be a potential therapeutic target for CRC
treatment.

The consumption of dietary fibers has been implicated with a lowered risk of
human colorectal cancer. Proposed mechanisms involve alterations in the stool
consistency, transit time, and formation of short-chain fatty acid by dietary
fiber fermentation, and the reorganization of gut microbiota. Here we show that
Fibersol-2, a digest-resistant maltodextrin, not only inhibits proliferation of
colorectal SW480 cancer cell lines by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS),
but decreases the numbers of the adenoma count in Multiple Intestinal Neoplasia
(MIN) mice carrying a mutation in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli gene by 84 d of 
age. These observations provide direct evidence that Fibersol-2 intrinsically
contains anti-cancer activity, independent of the intestinal metabolism and any
potential interactions with the microbiota.

Fusobacteria are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and are amplified during
colorectal carcinogenesis. Compared to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence of
carcinogenesis, serrated neoplasm has distinct clinical features and a different 
molecular background. We aimed to compare the gut microbiome between tubular
adenoma (TA) and sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P). Patients with TA, SSA/P,
or CRC were recruited. Three pieces of colorectal mucosal tissue were obtained
from each patient by endoscopic biopsy. 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and
phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states 
(PICRUSt) were performed. Among 26 enrolled patients, 8, 10, and 8 had TA, SSA/P,
and CRC, respectively. The relative abundance of Fusobacteria did not differ
significantly between the TA and SSA/P groups (4.3% and 1.9%, P = 0.739) but was 
higher in the CRC group (33.8%) than in the TA or SSA/P group, respectively (TA
vs. CRC, P = 0.002, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.023; SSA/P vs. CRC, P < 0.001,
FDR = 0.001). PICRUSt revealed that most functions in the TA metagenome were
similar to those in the SSA/P metagenome. The gut microbiome, including relative 
abundance of Fusobacteria, did not differ between TA and SSA/P, suggesting that
Fusobacteria may contribute to both the serrated pathway and the
adenoma-carcinoma sequence.

Dietary proteins influence colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, depending on their
quantity and quality. Here, using pyrosequencing, we compared the fecal
microbiota composition in Balb/c mice fed either a normal protein/carbohydrate
diet (ND, 20% casein and 68% carbohydrate) or a high-protein/low-carbohydrate
diet (HPLCD, 30% casein and 57% carbohydrate). The results showed that HPLCD
feeding for 2 weeks reduced the diversity and altered the composition of the
microbiota compared with the ND mice, which included a decrease in the proportion
of the family Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae and increases in the
proportions of the genus Bacteroides and Parabacteroides, especially the species 
EF09600_s and EF604598_s. Similar changes were reported in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease, and in mouse models of CRC and colitis, respectively.
This suggests that HPLCD may lead to a deleterious luminal environment and may
have adverse effects on the intestinal health of individuals consuming such a
diet.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Core 1- and core 3-derived mucin-type O-linked
oligosaccharides (O-glycans) are major components of the colonic mucus layer.
Defective forms of colonic O-glycans, such as the Thomsen-nouveau (Tn) antigen,
frequently are observed in patients with ulcerative colitis and colorectal
cancer, but it is not clear if they contribute to their pathogenesis. We
investigated whether and how impaired O-glycosylation contributes to the
development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer using mice lacking intestinal
core 1- and core 3-derived O-glycans.
METHODS: We generated mice that lack core 1- and core 3-derived intestinal
O-glycans (DKO mice) and analyzed them, along with mice that singly lack
intestinal epithelial core 1 O-glycans (IEC C1galt1(-/-) mice) or core 3
O-glycans (C3Gnt(-/-) mice). Intestinal tissues were collected at different time 
points and analyzed for levels of mucin and Tn antigen, development of colitis,
and tumor formation using imaging, quantitative polymerase chain reaction,
immunoblot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. We also used
cellular and genetic approaches, as well as intestinal microbiota depletion, to
identify inflammatory mediators and pathways that contribute to disease in DKO
and wild-type littermates (controls).
RESULTS: Intestinal tissues from DKO mice contained higher levels of Tn antigen
and had more severe spontaneous chronic colitis than tissues from IEC
C1galt1(-/-) mice, whereas spontaneous colitis was absent in C3GnT(-/-) and
control mice. IEC C1galt1(-/-) mice and DKO mice developed spontaneous colorectal
tumors, although the onset of tumors in the DKO mice occurred earlier (age, 8-9
months) than that in IEC C1galt1(-/-) mice (15 months old). Antibiotic depletion 
of the microbiota did not cause loss of Tn antigen but did reduce the development
of colitis and cancer formation in DKO mice. Colon tissues from DKO mice, but not
control mice, contained active forms of caspase 1 and increased caspase 11, which
were reduced after antibiotic administration. Supernatants from colon tissues of 
DKO mice contained increased levels of interleukin-1β and interleukin-18,
compared with those from control mice. Disruption of the caspase 1 and caspase 11
genes in DKO mice (DKO/Casp1/11(-/-) mice) decreased the development of colitis
and cancer, characterized by reduced colonic thickening, hyperplasia,
inflammatory infiltrate, and tumors compared with DKO mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired expression of O-glycans causes colonic mucus barrier breach
and subsequent microbiota-mediated activation of caspase 1-dependent
inflammasomes in colonic epithelial cells of mice. These processes could
contribute to colitis-associated colon cancer in humans.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death among
cancers in the United States. Although individuals diagnosed early have a greater
than 90% chance of survival, more than one-third of individuals do not adhere to 
screening recommendations partly because the standard diagnostics, colonoscopy
and sigmoidoscopy, are expensive and invasive. Thus, there is a great need to
improve the sensitivity of non-invasive tests to detect early stage cancers and
adenomas. Numerous studies have identified shifts in the composition of the gut
microbiota associated with the progression of CRC, suggesting that the gut
microbiota may represent a reservoir of biomarkers that would complement existing
non-invasive methods such as the widely used fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
METHODS: We sequenced the 16S rRNA genes from the stool samples of 490 patients. 
We used the relative abundances of the bacterial populations within each sample
to develop a random forest classification model that detects colonic lesions
using the relative abundance of gut microbiota and the concentration of
hemoglobin in stool.
RESULTS: The microbiota-based random forest model detected 91.7% of cancers and
45.5% of adenomas while FIT alone detected 75.0% and 15.7%, respectively. Of the 
colonic lesions missed by FIT, the model detected 70.0% of cancers and 37.7% of
adenomas. We confirmed known associations of Porphyromonas assaccharolytica,
Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Parvimonas micra, and Fusobacterium nucleatum with
CRC. Yet, we found that the loss of potentially beneficial organisms, such as
members of the Lachnospiraceae, was more predictive for identifying patients with
adenomas when used in combination with FIT.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential for microbiota analysis to 
complement existing screening methods to improve detection of colonic lesions.

The composition of the human microbiota influences tumorigenesis, notably in
colorectal cancer (CRC). Pathogenic Escherichia coli possesses a variety of
virulent factors, among them the Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT). CDT displays 
dual DNase and phosphatase activities and induces DNA double strand breaks, cell 
cycle arrest and apoptosis in a broad range of mammalian cells. As CDT could
promote malignant transformation, we investigated the cellular outcomes induced
by acute and chronic exposures to E. coli CDT in normal human colon epithelial
cells (HCECs). Moreover, we conducted a comparative study between isogenic
derivatives cell lines of the normal HCECs in order to mimic the mutation of
three major genes found in CRC genetic models: APC, KRAS, and TP53. Our results
demonstrate that APC and p53 deficient cells showed impaired DNA damage response 
after CDT exposure, whereas HCECs expressing oncogenic KRAS (V12) were more
resistant to CDT. Compared to normal HCECs, the precancerous derivatives exhibit 
hallmarks of malignant transformation after a chronic exposure to CDT. HCECs
defective in APC and p53 showed enhanced anchorage independent growth and genetic
instability, assessed by the micronucleus formation assay. In contrast, the
ability to grow independently of anchorage was not impacted by CDT chronic
exposure in KRAS(V12) HCECs, but micronucleus formation is dramatically
increased. Thus, CDT does not initiate CRC by itself, but may have promoting
effects in premalignant HCECs, involving different mechanisms in function of the 
genetic alterations associated to CRC.

Inflammation-associated pathways are active in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
and contribute to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Calcineurin, a
phosphatase required for the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T
cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, shows increased expression in CRC. 
We therefore investigated the role of calcineurin in intestinal tumor
development. We demonstrate that calcineurin and NFAT factors are constitutively 
expressed by primary IECs and selectively activated in intestinal tumors as a
result of impaired stratification of the tumor-associated microbiota and
toll-like receptor signaling. Epithelial calcineurin supports the survival and
proliferation of cancer stem cells in an NFAT-dependent manner and promotes the
development of intestinal tumors in mice. Moreover, somatic mutations that have
been identified in human CRC are associated with constitutive activation of
calcineurin, whereas nuclear translocation of NFAT is associated with increased
death from CRC. These findings highlight an epithelial cell-intrinsic pathway
that integrates signals derived from the commensal microbiota to promote
intestinal tumor development.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Investigation of microbe-metabolite relationships in the gut
is needed to understand and potentially reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) risk.
METHODS: Microbiota and metabolomics profiling were performed on lyophilized
feces from 42 CRC cases and 89 matched controls. Multivariable logistic
regression was used to identify statistically independent associations with CRC. 
First principal coordinate-component pair (PCo1-PC1) and false discovery rate
(0.05)-corrected P-values were calculated for 116,000 Pearson correlations
between 530 metabolites and 220 microbes in a sex*case/control meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Overall microbe-metabolite PCo1-PC1 was more strongly correlated in
cases than in controls (Rho 0.606 vs 0.201, P = 0.01). CRC was independently
associated with lower levels of Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, p-aminobenzoate and 
conjugated linoleate, and with higher levels of Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas,
p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, and palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Through postulated effects
on cell shedding (palmitoyl-sphingomyelin), inflammation (conjugated linoleate), 
and innate immunity (p-aminobenzoate), metabolites mediated the CRC association
with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas by 29% and 34%, respectively. Overall,
palmitoyl-sphingomyelin correlated directly with abundances of Enterobacteriaceae
(Gammaproteobacteria), three Actinobacteria and five Firmicutes. Only
Parabacteroides correlated inversely with palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Other lipids
correlated inversely with Alcaligenaceae (Betaproteobacteria). Six
Bonferroni-significant correlations were found, including low indolepropionate
and threnoylvaline with Actinobacteria and high erythronate and an
uncharacterized metabolite with Enterobacteriaceae.
CONCLUSIONS: Feces from CRC cases had very strong microbe-metabolite correlations
that were predominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Actinobacteria. Metabolites
mediated a direct CRC association with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas, but not
an inverse association with Clostridia and Lachnospiraceae. This study identifies
complex microbe-metabolite networks that may provide insights on neoplasia and
targets for intervention.

Most cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) are sporadic, and numerous studies have
suggested that gut microbiota may play a crucial role in CRC development.
Escherichia coli is a member of the gut microbiota frequently associated with
colorectal tumors. CRC-associated E. coli strains frequently harbor the pks
genomic island. This genomic island is responsible for the synthesis of
colibactin genotoxin, which increases tumor numbers in CRC mouse models. We
recently showed that targeting ClbP, a key enzyme involved in colibactin
synthesis, blocks the deleterious effect of this toxin in vitro and leads to a
significant decrease in tumor numbers in vivo. Altogether, our results suggest
that the personalized treatment of CRC should also take into consideration the
bacteria associated with the tumor in order to limit their deleterious effects.

Epigenetic and microbiome changes during pediatric development have been
implicated as important elements in the developmental origins of inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBDs) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),
which are linked to early onset colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic mucosal samples 
from 22 control children between 3.5 and 17.5 years of age were studied by
Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips and, in 10 cases, by 454 pyrosequencing of
the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Intercalating age-specific DNA methylation and
microbiome changes were identified, which may have significant translational
relevance in the developmental origins of IBD and CRC.

Colon cancer stem cells (CSCs) offer a novel paradigm for colorectal cancer (CRC)
treatment and dietary polyphenols may contribute to battle these cells.
Specifically, polyphenol-derived colon metabolites have the potential to interact
with and affect colon CSCs. We herein report the effects against colon CSCs of
two mixtures of ellagitannin (ET) metabolites, ellagic acid (EA) and the gut
microbiota-derived urolithins (Uro) at concentrations detected in the human colon
tissues following the intake of ET-containing products (pomegranate, walnuts).
These mixtures reduce phenotypic and molecular features in two models of colon
CSCs: Caco-2 cells and primary tumour cells from a patient with CRC. The mixture 
containing mostly Uro-A (85% Uro-A, 10% Uro-C, 5% EA) was most effective at
inhibiting the number and size of colonospheres and aldehyde dehydrogenase
activity (ALDH, a marker of chemoresistance) whereas the mixture containing less 
Uro-A but IsoUro-A and Uro-B (30% Uro-A, 50% IsoUro-A, 10% Uro-B, 5% Uro-C, 5%
EA) had some effects on the number and size of colonospheres but not on ALDH.
These data support a role for polyphenols metabolites in the control of colon
cancer chemoresistance and relapse and encourage the research on the effects of
polyphenols against CSCs.

OBJECTIVE: A signature that unifies the colorectal cancer (CRC) microbiota across
multiple studies has not been identified. In addition to methodological variance,
heterogeneity may be caused by both microbial and host response differences,
which was addressed in this study.
DESIGN: We prospectively studied the colonic microbiota and the expression of
specific host response genes using faecal and mucosal samples ('ON' and 'OFF' the
tumour, proximal and distal) from 59 patients undergoing surgery for CRC, 21
individuals with polyps and 56 healthy controls. Microbiota composition was
determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing; expression of host genes involved in 
CRC progression and immune response was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: The microbiota of patients with CRC differed from that of controls, but 
alterations were not restricted to the cancerous tissue. Differences between
distal and proximal cancers were detected and faecal microbiota only partially
reflected mucosal microbiota in CRC. Patients with CRC can be stratified based on
higher level structures of mucosal-associated bacterial co-abundance groups
(CAGs) that resemble the previously formulated concept of enterotypes. Of these, 
Bacteroidetes Cluster 1 and Firmicutes Cluster 1 were in decreased abundance in
CRC mucosa, whereas Bacteroidetes Cluster 2, Firmicutes Cluster 2, Pathogen
Cluster and Prevotella Cluster showed increased abundance in CRC mucosa.
CRC-associated CAGs were differentially correlated with the expression of host
immunoinflammatory response genes.
CONCLUSIONS: CRC-associated microbiota profiles differ from those in healthy
subjects and are linked with distinct mucosal gene-expression profiles.
Compositional alterations in the microbiota are not restricted to cancerous
tissue and differ between distal and proximal cancers.

It is now widely recognized that a range of human diseases, including obesity,
cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, is strongly linked to the microbiota. For 
decades, the microbiota has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of
colon cancer. Our recent work reveals that the organization of the mucosal
microbiota into biofilms marks a subset of human colon cancer. Further,
biofilm-positive colon mucosa in the colon cancer host yields an infrequently
detected polyamine metabolite, N(1), N(12)-diacetylspermine, that deserves
further study to determine its utility as a marker for colon neoplasia.

BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation and composition of the colon microbiota have
been associated with colorectal cancer in humans. The human commensal
enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is linked to both inflammatory bowel 
disease and colorectal cancer and, in our murine model, causes interleukin 17A
(IL-17A)-dependent colon tumors. In these studies, we hypothesized that
persistent colonization by ETBF is required for tumorigenesis.
METHODS: We established a method for clearing ETBF in mice, using the antibiotic 
cefoxitin. Multiple intestinal neoplasia mice were colonized with ETBF for the
experiment duration or were cleared of infection after 5 or 14 days. Gross tumors
and/or microadenomas were then evaluated. In parallel, IL-17A expression was
evaluated in wild-type littermates.
RESULTS: Cefoxitin treatment resulted in complete and durable clearance of ETBF
colonization. We observed a stepwise increase in median colon tumor numbers as
the duration of ETBF colonization increased before cefoxitin treatment. ETBF
eradication also significantly decreased mucosal IL-17A expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The timing of ETBF clearance profoundly influences colon adenoma
formation, defining a period during which the colon is susceptible to
IL-17A-dependent tumorigenesis in this murine model. This model system can be
used to study the microbiota-dependent and molecular mechanisms contributing to
IL-17A-dependent colon tumor initiation.

This study evaluated whether dietary resistant starch (RS) and green tea extract 
(GTE), which have anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, protect against
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) using a rat model, also investigated
potential mechanisms of action of these agents including their effects on the gut
microbiota. Rats were fed a control diet or diets containing 10% RS, 0.5% GTE or 
a combination of the two (RS + GTE). CAC was initiated with 2 weekly azoxymethane
(AOM) injections (10mg/kg) followed by 2% dextran sodium sulphate in drinking
water for 7 days after 2 weeks on diets. Rats were killed 20 weeks after the
first AOM. Colon tissues and tumours were examined for histopathology by H&E,
gene/protein expression by PCR and immunohistochemistry and digesta for analyses 
of fermentation products and microbiota populations. RS and RS + GTE (but not
GTE) diets significantly (P< 0.05) decreased tumour multiplicity and
adenocarcinoma formation, relative to the control diet. Effects of RS + GTE were 
not different from RS alone. RS diet caused significant shifts in microbial
composition/diversity, with increases in Parabacteroides, Barnesiella,
Ruminococcus, Marvinbryantia and Bifidobacterium as primary contributors to the
shift. RS-containing diets increased short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and
expression of the SCFA receptor GPR43 mRNA, and reduced inflammation (COX-2,
NF-kB, TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA) and cell proliferation P< 0.05. GTE had no effect.
This is the first study that demonstrates chemopreventive effects of RS (but not 
GTE) in a rodent CAC model, suggesting RS might have benefit to patients with
ulcerative colitis who are at an increased risk of developing CRC.

Gut microbiota and dietary fiber are critical for protecting body from obesity,
diabetes and cancer. Butyrate, produced in the gut by bacterial fermentation of
dietary fibers, is demonstrated to be protective against the development of
colorectal cancer as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. We report that
high-fiber diet and butyrate significantly inhibited the growth lymphoma tumors. 
Butyrate induced apoptosis of lymphoma tumor cells and significantly up-regulated
histone 3 acetylation (H3ac) level and target genes such as Fas, P21, P27. Our
results unravel an instrumental role of fiber diet and their metabolites on
lymphoma tumor and demonstrate an intervention potential on the prevention and
therapy of lymphoma.

The beneficial roles of probiotics in lowering the gastrointestinal inflammation 
and preventing colorectal cancer have been frequently demonstrated, but their
immunomodulatory effects and mechanism in suppressing the growth of
extraintestinal tumors remain unexplored. Here, we adopted a mouse model and
metagenome sequencing to investigate the efficacy of probiotic feeding in
controlling s.c. hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying mechanism
suppressing the tumor progression. Our result demonstrated that Prohep, a novel
probiotic mixture, slows down the tumor growth significantly and reduces the
tumor size and weight by 40% compared with the control. From a mechanistic point 
of view the down-regulated IL-17 cytokine and its major producer Th17 cells,
whose levels decreased drastically, played critical roles in tumor reduction upon
probiotics feeding. Cell staining illustrated that the reduced Th17 cells in the 
tumor of the probiotic-treated group is mainly caused by the reduced frequency of
migratory Th17 cells from the intestine and peripheral blood. In addition,
shotgun-metagenome sequencing revealed the crosstalk between gut microbial
metabolites and the HCC development. Probiotics shifted the gut microbial
community toward certain beneficial bacteria, including Prevotella and
Oscillibacter, that are known producers of antiinflammatory metabolites, which
subsequently reduced the Th17 polarization and promoted the differentiation of
antiinflammatory Treg/Tr1 cells in the gut. Overall, our study offers novel
insights into the mechanism by which probiotic treatment modulates the microbiota
and influences the regulation of the T-cell differentiation in the gut, which in 
turn alters the level of the proinflammatory cytokines in the extraintestinal
tumor microenvironment.

OPINION STATEMENT: Colorectal cancer (CRC) forms an important public health
problem, especially in developed countries. CRC screening tests can be used to
identify asymptomatic individuals with CRC precursors and (early) cancer. Removal
of these lesions reduces CRC incidence and prevents CRC-related mortality. There 
are a range of screening tests available, each with advantages and disadvantages.
Stool screening tests can broadly be divided into fecal occult blood tests
(FOBTs) and molecular biomarker test, such as DNA/RNA marker tests, protein
markers, and fecal microbiome marker tests. Guaiac fecal occult blood tests
(gFOBT) have been demonstrated in large randomized screening trials to reduce CRC
mortality. Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) have superior adherence, usability,
and accuracy as compared to gFOBT. Advantage of the use of quantitative FITs in
CRC screening programs is the cut-off level that can be adjusted. Molecular
biomarker DNA tests have shown to detect significantly more cancers than FIT. By 
combining biomarker DNA tests with FIT, sensitivity for advanced adenomas can be 
increased significantly. However, it has lower specificity thus demands more
colonoscopy resources, is more cumbersome, and costly. The adherence has not been
assessed in population screening trials. For these reasons, FIT is therefore at
present regarded as the preferred method of non-invasive CRC screening. This
chapter will review the current status of fecal test-based CRC screening.

Colorectal carcinoma is considered the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths
worldwide. Several microorganisms have been associated with carcinogenesis,
including Enterococcus spp., Helicobacter pylori, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides
fragilis, pathogenic E. coli strains and oral Fusobacterium. Here we
qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the presence of oral and intestinal
microorganisms in the fecal microbiota of colorectal cancer patients and healthy 
controls. Seventeen patients (between 49 and 70 years-old) visiting the Cancer
Institute of the Sao Paulo State were selected, 7 of whom were diagnosed with
colorectal carcinoma. Bacterial detection was performed by qRT-PCR. Although all 
of the tested bacteria were detected in the majority of the fecal samples,
quantitative differences between the Cancer Group and healthy controls were
detected only for F. nucleatum and C. difficile. The three tested oral
microorganisms were frequently observed, suggesting a need for furthers studies
into a potential role for these bacteria during colorectal carcinoma
pathogenesis. Despite the small number of patients included in this study, we
were able to detect significantly more F. nucleatum and C. difficile in the
Cancer Group patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a possible role of
these bacteria in colon carcinogenesis. This finding should be considered when
screening for colorectal cancer.

The aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of the perioperative
administration of probiotics in patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC)
surgery. The study focused on a total of 156 consecutive surgeries carried out
from among all the elective CRC surgeries performed between April 2009 and March 
2013. The patients involved in surgeries undertaken between April 2009 and
October 2011 were placed in the non-probiotic group (group A, 81 patients) and
those involved in surgeries between November 2011 and March 2013 were placed in
the probiotic group (group B, 75 patients). Postoperative infectious
complications were recorded, and the immune responses and fecal microbiota were
determined. A breakdown of infectious complications showed that 21 (13.5%)
patients experienced superficial incisional surgical site infections (SSIs), of
which 16 patients were from group A (19.8%), and five patients from group B
(6.7%) (P=0.016). The ImmuKnow® adenosine triphosphate values peaked on the first
postoperative day (POD) in both groups. In group A, the ImmuKnow value of the
first POD was increased significantly compared with the preoperative value
(P=0.022). In group B, the value of the first POD did not increase compared with 
the preoperative value (P=0.28). In conclusion, probiotic treatment can reduce
superficial incisional SSIs in patients undergoing CRC surgery. Perioperative
probiotic treatment can enhance immune responses and improve the intestinal
microbial environment.

OBJECTIVE: To compare fecal microbiota and metabolites between colorectal cancer 
(CRC) patients and healthy population.
METHODS: Feces from fifteen CRC patients and twelve normal people were analyzed
by using pyrosequencing and gas chromatography mass spectrometry(GC/MS).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the overall microbial community
structure associated with the disease state, but 18 bacterial genera were
underrepresented or overrepresented in the CRC samples. GC-MS profiling revealed 
higher concentrations for 9 kinds of amino acids and metabolites of short-chain
fatty acids, lower concentrations for 3 kinds of unsaturated fatty acids and 2
kinds of glycerin and ursodeoxycholic acid in stool samples from CRC patients.
Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential
relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species.
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in fecal metabolites and the
relative abundance of certain types of bacteria between CRC patients and healthy 
people, which can provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer 
environment and will help direct future mechanism studies.

Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) represents an enormous problem worldwide. Large 
intestinal microbiota play an important role in the colorectal carcinogenesis.
The aim of the study was to investigate anti-Outer membrane protein C (anti-OmpC)
antibodies, aimed at porin C, which is embedded in the outer membrane of
gram-negative bacteria, in patients with colorectal adenoma (CRA), CRC and
controls. The study included 22 patients with CRA (11 men, 11 women, aged 26-79, 
mean 65 ± 12), 11 patients with CRC (9 men, 2 women, aged 50-83, mean 66 ± 11)
and 45 controls, blood donors (24 men, 21 women, aged 20-58, mean 38 ± 10). Serum
anti-OmpC antibodies were investigated by means of ELISA. Values of 0-20 U/mL
were considered to be negative; values >25 U/mL were assessed as positive. A
total of 9/11 (82 %) patients with CRC had positive anti-OmpC antibodies.
Anti-OmpC antibodies were negative or grey-zone in 37/45 (82 %) controls. Serum
anti-OmpC were found to be significantly higher in patients with CRC (median
42.4, interquartile range (IQR) 22.2) compared to controls (median 18.3, IQR
12.4), p < 0.001. No statistically significant difference in anti-OmpC was found 
between controls (median 18.3, IQR 12.4) and CRA patients (median 17.7, IQR
16.5), p = 0.326. Anti-OmpC were significantly higher in patients with CRC
(median 42.4, IQR 22.2) compared to patients with CRA (median 17.7, IQR 16.5),
p = 0.011. Positivity of anti-OmpC antibodies was found in patients with CRC,
which supports the contribution of gram-negative large intestinal microbiota to
the pathogenesis of CRC.

We recently identified three metabotypes (0, A and B) that depend on the
metabolic profile of urolithins produced from polyphenol ellagic acid (EA). The
gut microbiota and Gordonibacter spp. recently were identified as species able to
produce urolithins. A higher percentage of metabotype B was found in patients
with metabolic syndrome or colorectal cancer in comparison with healthy
individuals. The aim of the present study was to analyse differences in EA
metabolism between healthy overweight-obese and normoweight individuals and
evaluate the role of gut microbial composition including Gordonibacter. Although 
the three metabotypes were confirmed in both groups, metabotype B prevailed in
overweight-obese (31%) versus normoweight (20%) individuals while metabotype A
was higher in normoweight (70%) than the overweight-obese group (57%). This
suggests that weight gain favours the growth of bacteria capable of producing
urolithin B and/or isourolithin A with respect to urolithin A-producing bacteria.
Gordonibacter spp. levels were not significantly different between normoweight
and overweight-obese groups but higher Gordonibacter levels were found in
metabotype A individuals than in those with metabotype B. Other bacterial species
have been reported to show a much closer relationship to obesity and dysbiosis
than Gordonibacter. However, Gordonibacter levels are negatively correlated with 
metabotype B, which prevails in metabolic syndrome and colorectal cancer. This is
the first report that links overweight and obesity with an alteration in the
catabolism of EA, and where the correlation of Gordonibacter to this alteration
is shown. Future investigation of Gordonibacter and urolithin metabotypes as
potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets of obesity-related diseases is
warranted.

A deterministic oscillatory model of microtubule growth and shrinkage for
differential actions of short chain fatty acids.

Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield S1 3JD, UK.

Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), principally acetate, propionate, butyrate and
valerate, are produced in pharmacologically relevant concentrations by the gut
microbiome. Investigations indicate that they exert beneficial effects on colon
epithelia. There is increasing interest in whether different SCFAs have distinct 
functions which may be exploited for prevention or treatment of colonic diseases 
including colorectal cancer (CRC), inflammatory bowel disease and obesity. Based 
on experimental evidence, we hypothesised that odd-chain SCFAs may possess
anti-mitotic capabilities in colon cancer cells by disrupting microtubule (MT)
structural integrity via dysregulation of β-tubulin isotypes. MT dynamic
instability is an essential characteristic of MT cellular activity. We report a
minimal deterministic model that takes a novel approach to explore the
hypothesised pathway by triggering spontaneous oscillations to represent MT
dynamic behaviour. The dynamicity parameters in silico were compared to those
reported in vitro. Simulations of untreated and butyrate (even-chain length)
treated cells reflected MT behaviour in interphase or untreated control cells.
The propionate and valerate (odd-chain length) simulations displayed increased
catastrophe frequencies and longer periods of MT-fibre shrinkage. Their enhanced 
dynamicity was dissimilar to that observed in mitotic cells, but parallel to that
induced by MT-destabilisation treatments. Antimicrotubule drugs act through
upward or downward modulation of MT dynamic instability. Our computational
modelling suggests that metabolic engineering of the microbiome may facilitate
managing CRC risk by predicting outcomes of SCFA treatments in combination with
AMDs.

AIM: To evaluate ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in colonic
pathophysiology as they had recently been related to colorectal cancer (CRC)
development.
METHODS: Literature search was conducted on PubMed using combinations of the
following terms: ABC transporters, ATP binding cassette transporter proteins,
inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative, colitis, Crohn's disease, colorectal
cancer, colitis, intestinal inflammation, intestinal carcinogenesis,
ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp/CD243/MDR1), ABCC2/multidrug resistance protein 2
(MRP2) and ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), Abcb1/Mdr1a,
abcc2/Mrp2, abcg2/Bcrp, knock-out mice, tight junction, membrane lipid function.
RESULTS: Recently, human studies reported that changes in the levels of ABC
transporters were early events in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence leading to CRC. 
A link between ABCB1, high fat diet and gut microbes in relation to colitis was
suggested by the animal studies. The finding that colitis was preceded by altered
gut bacterial composition suggests that deletion of Abcb1 leads to fundamental
changes of host-microbiota interaction. Also, high fat diet increases the
frequency and severity of colitis in specific pathogen-free Abcb1 KO mice. The
Abcb1 KO mice might thus serve as a model in which diet/environmental factors and
microbes may be controlled and investigated in relation to intestinal
inflammation. Potential molecular mechanisms include defective transport of
inflammatory mediators and/or phospholipid translocation from one side to the
other of the cell membrane lipid bilayer by ABC transporters affecting
inflammatory response and/or function of tight junctions, phagocytosis and
vesicle trafficking. Also, diet and microbes give rise to molecules which are
potential substrates for the ABC transporters and which may additionally affect
ABC transporter function through nuclear receptors and transcriptional
regulation. Another critical role of ABCB1 was suggested by the finding that
ABCB1 expression identifies a subpopulation of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells which 
were resistant to treatment with glucocorticoids. The evidence for the
involvement of ABCC2 and ABCG2 in colonic pathophysiology was weak.
CONCLUSION: ABCB1, diet, and gut microbes mutually interact in colonic
inflammation, a well-known risk factor for CRC. Further insight may be translated
into preventive and treatment strategies.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
Japan. The etiology of CRC has been linked to numerous factors including genetic 
mutation, diet, life style, inflammation, and recently, the gut microbiota.
However, CRC-associated gut microbiota is still largely unexamined. This study
used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and
next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze and compare gut microbiota of
Japanese control subjects and Japanese patients with carcinoma in adenoma. Stool 
samples were collected from 49 control subjects, 50 patients with colon adenoma, 
and 9 patients with colorectal cancer (3/9 with invasive cancer and 6/9 with
carcinoma in adenoma) immediately before colonoscopy; DNA was extracted from each
stool sample. Based on T-RFLP analysis, 12 subjects (six control and six
carcinoma in adenoma subjects) were selected; their samples were used for NGS and
species-level analysis. T-RFLP analysis showed no significant differences in
bacterial population between control, adenoma and cancer groups. However, NGS
revealed that i), control and carcinoma in adenoma subjects had different gut
microbiota compositions, ii), one bacterial genus (Slackia) was significantly
associated with the control group and four bacterial genera (Actinomyces,
Atopobium, Fusobacterium, and Haemophilus) were significantly associated with the
carcinoma-in-adenoma group, and iii), several bacterial species were
significantly associated with each type (control: Eubacterium coprostanoligens;
carcinoma in adenoma: Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides fragiles,
Clostridium nexile, Fusobacterium varium, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Prevotella 
stercorea, Streptococcus gordonii, and Veillonella dispar). Gut microbial
properties differ between control subjects and carcinoma-in-adenoma patients in
this Japanese population, suggesting that gut microbiota is related to CRC
prevention and development.

Gut microbial dysbiosis contributes to the development of colorectal cancer
(CRC). Here we catalogue the microbial communities in human gut mucosae at
different stages of colorectal tumorigenesis. We analyse the gut mucosal
microbiome of 47 paired samples of adenoma and adenoma-adjacent mucosae, 52
paired samples of carcinoma and carcinoma-adjacent mucosae and 61 healthy
controls. Probabilistic partitioning of relative abundance profiles reveals that 
a metacommunity predominated by members of the oral microbiome is primarily
associated with CRC. Analysis of paired samples shows differences in community
configurations between lesions and the adjacent mucosae. Correlations of
bacterial taxa indicate early signs of dysbiosis in adenoma, and co-exclusive
relationships are subsequently more common in cancer. We validate these
alterations in CRC-associated microbiome by comparison with two previously
published data sets. Our results suggest that a taxonomically defined microbial
consortium is implicated in the development of CRC.

Contribution of Macromolecular Antioxidants to Dietary Antioxidant Capacity: A
Study in the Spanish Mediterranean Diet.

Epidemiological and clinical studies show that diets with a high antioxidant
capacity, such us those rich in plant food and beverages, are associated with
significant decreases in the overall risk of cardiovascular disease or colorectal
cancer. Current studies on dietary antioxidants and dietary antioxidant capacity 
focus exclusively on low molecular weight or soluble antioxidants (vitamins C and
E, phenolic compounds and carotenoids), ignoring macromolecular antioxidants.
These are polymeric phenolic compounds or polyphenols and carotenoids linked to
plant food macromolecules that yield bioavailable metabolites by the action of
the microbiota with significant effects either local and/or systemic after
absorption. This study determined the antioxidant capacity of the Spanish
Mediterranean diet including for the first time both soluble and macromolecular
antioxidants. Antioxidant capacity and consumption data of the 54 most consumed
plant foods and beverages were used. Results showed that macromolecular
antioxidants are the major dietary antioxidants, contributing a 61% to the diet
antioxidant capacity (8000 μmol Trolox, determined by ABTS method). The
antioxidant capacity data for foods and beverages provided here may be used to
estimate the dietary antioxidant capacity in different populations, where similar
contributions of macromolecular antioxidants may be expected, and also to design 
antioxidant-rich diets. Including macromolecular antioxidants in mechanistic,
intervention and observational studies on dietary antioxidants may contribute to 
a better understanding of the role of antioxidants in nutrition and health.

The reported inverse association between the intake of plant-based foods and a
reduction in the prevalence of colorectal cancer may be partly mediated by
interactions between insoluble fibre and (poly)phenols and the intestinal
microbiota. In the present study, we assessed the impact of palm date
consumption, rich in both polyphenols and fibre, on the growth of colonic
microbiota and markers of colon cancer risk in a randomised, controlled,
cross-over human intervention study. A total of twenty-two healthy human
volunteers were randomly assigned to either a control group
(maltodextrin-dextrose, 37·1 g) or an intervention group (seven dates,
approximately 50 g). Each arm was of 21 d duration and was separated by a 14-d
washout period in a cross-over manner. Changes in the growth of microbiota were
assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis, whereas SCFA levels were
assessed using HPLC. Further, ammonia concentrations, faecal water genotoxicity
and anti-proliferation ability were also assessed using different assays, which
included cell work and the Comet assay. Accordingly, dietary intakes,
anthropometric measurements and bowel movement assessment were also carried out. 
Although the consumption of dates did not induce significant changes in the
growth of select bacterial groups or SCFA, there were significant increases in
bowel movements and stool frequency (P<0·01; n 21) and significant reductions in 
stool ammonia concentration (P<0·05; n 21) after consumption of dates, relative
to baseline. Furthermore, date fruit intake significantly reduced genotoxicity in
human faecal water relative to control (P<0·01; n 21). Our data indicate that
consumption of date fruit may reduce colon cancer risk without inducing changes
in the microbiota.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) from 
faecal metagenomes.
DESIGN: We performed metagenome-wide association studies on faecal samples from
74 patients with CRC and 54 controls from China, and validated the results in 16 
patients and 24 controls from Denmark. We further validated the biomarkers in two
published cohorts from France and Austria. Finally, we employed targeted
quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to evaluate diagnostic potential of selected
biomarkers in an independent Chinese cohort of 47 patients and 109 controls.
RESULTS: Besides confirming known associations of Fusobacterium nucleatum and
Peptostreptococcus stomatis with CRC, we found significant associations with
several species, including Parvimonas micra and Solobacterium moorei. We
identified 20 microbial gene markers that differentiated CRC and control
microbiomes, and validated 4 markers in the Danish cohort. In the French and
Austrian cohorts, these four genes distinguished CRC metagenomes from controls
with areas under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.77,
respectively. qPCR measurements of two of these genes accurately classified
patients with CRC in the independent Chinese cohort with AUC=0.84 and OR of 23.
These genes were enriched in early-stage (I-II) patient microbiomes, highlighting
the potential for using faecal metagenomic biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first metagenomic profiling study of CRC faecal
microbiomes to discover and validate microbial biomarkers in ethnically different
cohorts, and to independently validate selected biomarkers using an affordable
clinically relevant technology. Our study thus takes a step further towards
affordable non-invasive early diagnostic biomarkers for CRC from faecal samples.

Dietary components such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and prebiotics can modulate
the intestinal microbiota and are thought to be involved in the reduction of
colorectal cancer risk. The presented study measured, using the comet assay, the 
antigenotoxic activity of both probiotic and non-probiotic LAB, as well as some
prebiotics and the end-products of their fermentation, against fecal water (FW). 
The production of short chain fatty acids by the bacteria was quantified using
HPLC. Seven out of the ten tested viable strains significantly decreased DNA
damage induced by FW. The most effective of them were Lactobacillus mucosae 0988 
and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb-12, leading to a 76% and 80% decrease
in genotoxicity, respectively. The end-products of fermentation of seven
prebiotics by Lactobacillus casei DN 114-001 exhibited the strongest
antigenotoxic activity against FW, with fermented inulin reducing genotoxicity by
75%. Among the tested bacteria, this strain produced the highest amounts of
butyrate in the process of prebiotic fermentation, and especially from resistant 
dextrin (4.09 μM/mL). Fermented resistant dextrin improved DNA repair by 78% in
cells pre-treated with 6.8 μM methylnitronitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Fermented
inulin induced stronger DNA repair in cells pre-treated with mutagens (FW, 25 μM 
hydrogen peroxide, or MNNG) than non-fermented inulin, and the efficiency of DNA 
repair after 120 min of incubation decreased by 71%, 50% and 70%, respectively.
The different degrees of genotoxicity inhibition observed for the various
combinations of bacteria and prebiotics suggest that this effect may be
attributable to carbohydrate type, SCFA yield, and the ratio of the end-products 
of prebiotic fermentation.

Baicalin is a major constituent of Scutellaria baicalensis, which is a commonly
used herbal medicine in many Asian countries. After oral ingestion, intestinal
microbiota metabolism may change parent compound's structure and its biological
activities. However, whether baicalin can be metabolized by enteric microbiota
and the related anticancer activity is not clear. In this study, using human
enteric microbiome incubation and HPLC analysis, we observed that baicalin can be
quickly converted to baicalein. We compared the antiproliferative effects of
baicalin and baicalein using a panel of human cancer cell lines, including three 
human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. In vitro antiproliferative effects on
CRC cells were verified using an in vivo xenograft nude mouse model. Baicalin
showed limited antiproliferative effects on some of these cancer cell lines.
Baicalein, however, showed significant antiproliferative effects in all the
tested cancer cell lines, especially on HCT-116 human colorectal cancer cells. In
vivo antitumor results supported our in vitro data. We demonstrated that
baicalein exerts potent S phase cell cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic effects in
HCT-116 cells. Baicalein induced the activation of caspase 3 and 9. The in silico
modeling suggested that baicalein forms hydrogen bonds with residues Ser251 and
Asp253 at the active site of caspase 3, while interactions with residues Leu227
and Asp228 in caspase 9 through its hydroxyl groups. Data from this study
suggested that baicalein is a potent anticancer metabolite derived from S.
baicalensis. Enteric microbiota play a key role in the colon cancer
chemoprevention of S. baicalensis.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence links colorectal cancer (CRC) with the
intestinal microbiota. However, the disturbance of intestinal microbiota and the 
role of Fusobacterium nucleatum during the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence 
have not yet been evaluated.
METHODS: 454 FLX pyrosequencing was used to evaluate the disturbance of
intestinal microbiota during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence pathway of CRC.
Intestinal microbiota and mucosa tumor-immune cytokines were detected in mice
after introducing 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), F. nucleatum or Berberine (BBR),
using pyrosequencing and Bio-Plex Pro™ cytokine assays, respectively. Protein
expressions were detected by western blotting.
RESULTS: The levels of opportunistic pathogens, such as Fusobacterium,
Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. gradually increased during the colorectal
adenoma-carcinoma sequence in human fecal and mucosal samples. F. nucleatum
treatment significantly altered lumen microbial structures, with increased
Tenericutes and Verrucomicrobia (opportunistic pathogens) (P < 0.05 = in
wild-type C57BL/6 and mice with DMH treatment). BBR intervention reversed the F. 
nucleatum-mediated increase in opportunistic pathogens, and the secretion of
IL-21/22/31, CD40L and the expression of p-STAT3, p-STAT5 and p-ERK1/2 in mice,
compared with mice fed with F. nucleatum alone.
CONCLUSIONS: F. nucleatum colonization in the intestine may prompt colorectal
tumorigenesis. BBR could rescue F. nucleatum-induced colorectal tumorigenesis by 
modulating the tumor microenvironment and blocking the activation of
tumorigenesis-related pathways.

The crosstalk between inflammation and tumorigenesis is now clearly established. 
However, how inflammation is elicited in the metastatic environment and the
corresponding contribution of innate immunity pathways in suppressing tumor
growth at secondary sites are poorly understood. Here, we show that mice
deficient in Nlrp3 inflammasome components had exacerbated liver colorectal
cancer metastatic growth, which was mediated by impaired interleukin-18 (IL-18)
signaling. Control of tumor growth was independent of differential cancer cell
colonization or proliferation, intestinal microbiota effects, or tumoricidal
activity by the adaptive immune system. Instead, the inflammasome-IL-18 pathway
impacted maturation of hepatic NK cells, surface expression of the death ligand
FasL, and capacity to kill FasL-sensitive tumors. Our results define a regulatory
signaling circuit within the innate immune system linking inflammasome activation
to effective NK-cell-mediated tumor attack required to suppress colorectal cancer
growth in the liver.

Recent studies investigating the human microbiome have identified particular
bacterial species that correlate with the presence of colorectal cancer. To
evaluate the role of qualitatively different but naturally occurring gut
microbiota and the relationship with colorectal cancer development, genetically
identical embryos from the Polyposis in Rat Colon (Pirc) rat model of colorectal 
cancer were transferred into recipients of three different genetic backgrounds
(F344/NHsd, LEW/SsNHsd, and Crl:SD). Tumor development in the pups was tracked
longitudinally via colonoscopy, and end-stage tumor burden was determined. To
confirm vertical transmission and identify associations between the gut
microbiota and disease phenotype, the fecal microbiota was characterized in
recipient dams 24 hours pre-partum, and in Pirc rat offspring prior to and during
disease progression. Our data show that the gut microbiota varies between rat
strains, with LEW/SsNHsd having a greater relative abundance of the bacteria
Prevotella copri. The mature gut microbiota of pups resembled the profile of
their dams, indicating that the dam is the primary determinant of the developing 
microbiota. Both male and female F344-Pirc rats harboring the Lewis microbiota
had decreased tumor burden relative to genetically identical rats harboring F344 
or SD microbiota. Significant negative correlations were detected between tumor
burden and the relative abundance of specific taxa from samples taken at weaning 
and shortly thereafter, prior to observable adenoma development. Notably, this
naturally occurring variation in the gut microbiota is associated with a
significant difference in severity of colorectal cancer, and the abundance of
certain taxa is associated with decreased tumor burden.

AIMS: To investigate the antitumor effects of probiotics Clostridium butyricum
and Bacillus subtilis on colorectal cancer (CRC) progression.
MATERIALS & METHODS: The effects of C. butyricum and B. subtilis on CRC cells
were studied. Male C57BL/6 mice with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride
(DMH)-induced CRC were intervened by these two probiotics and the antitumor
effects were examined by comparing the tumor incidence and detecting the
inflammatory and immune-related markers.
RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS: C. butyricum and B. subtilis inhibited the proliferation
of CRC cells, caused cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis. In vivo, these two
probiotics inhibited the development of DMH-induced CRC. The molecular mechanism 
involved reduced inflammation and improved immune homeostasis. This work
establishes a basis for the protective role of probiotics B. subtilis and C.
butyricum in intestinal tumorigenesis.

OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence links the intestinal microbiota and colorectal
carcinogenesis. Fusobacterium nucleatum may promote colorectal tumour growth and 
inhibit T cell-mediated immune responses against colorectal tumours. Thus, we
hypothesised that the amount of F. nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma might be
associated with worse clinical outcome.
DESIGN: We used molecular pathological epidemiology database of 1069 rectal and
colon cancer cases in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study, and measured F. nucleatum DNA in carcinoma tissue. Cox
proportional hazards model was used to compute hazard ratio (HR), controlling for
potential confounders, including microsatellite instability (MSI, mismatch repair
deficiency), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA
mutations, and LINE-1 hypomethylation (low-level methylation).
RESULTS: Compared with F. nucleatum-negative cases, multivariable HRs (95% CI)
for colorectal cancer-specific mortality in F. nucleatum-low cases and F.
nucleatum-high cases were 1.25 (0.82 to 1.92) and 1.58 (1.04 to 2.39),
respectively, (p for trend=0.020). The amount of F. nucleatum was associated with
MSI-high (multivariable odd ratio (OR), 5.22; 95% CI 2.86 to 9.55) independent of
CIMP and BRAF mutation status, whereas CIMP and BRAF mutation were associated
with F. nucleatum only in univariate analyses (p<0.001) but not in multivariate
analysis that adjusted for MSI status.
CONCLUSIONS: The amount of F. nucleatum DNA in colorectal cancer tissue is
associated with shorter survival, and may potentially serve as a prognostic
biomarker. Our data may have implications in developing cancer prevention and
treatment strategies through targeting GI microflora by diet, probiotics and
antibiotics.

BACKGROUND: Microbiotical dysbiosis induced by a Western diet seems to be
associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Few
other factors with an effect on the colonic microbiota and their association with
CRC have been evaluated.
AIM: We investigated whether the use of antibiotics is associated with CRC risk.
METHODS: Data on the use of antibiotics and comedication were extracted from a
health insurance database for subjects with a diagnostic-related group for CRC
between 2006 and 2011 and four age- and sex-matched controls. Antibiotic use was 
categorized according to the number of prescriptions during a 5-year follow-up
period (1-6 years prior to CRC). Multivariable conditional binary logistic
regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence
intervals (95 % CIs) for different levels of use.
RESULTS: A total of 4029 cases (47 % male, mean age at diagnosis 71 ± 11 years)
and 15,988 controls were included. Antibiotics had been prescribed to 2630 (65.3 
%) cases and 10,234 (64.0 %) controls (p = 0.13). An increasing use of
antibiotics was associated with an increasing risk of CRC [multivariable OR for
high (≥8 prescriptions) vs. no prescriptions: 1.26, 95 % CI 1.11-1.44, p-trend
<0.01]. For each increase of 5 prescriptions, the OR for CRC was 1.05 (95 % CI
1.01-1.09).
CONCLUSION: We found an association between the use of antibiotics, especially
when used frequently, and the risk of developing CRC. Further studies are needed 
to establish under which conditions the use of antibiotics increases the risk of 
developing CRC.

BACKGROUND: Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous colorectal
adenoma (CRA) can detect curable disease. However, participation in colonoscopy
and sensitivity of fecal heme for CRA are low.
METHODS: Microbiota metrics were determined by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA
genes amplified from DNA extracted from feces self-collected in RNAlater. Among
fecal immunochemical test-positive (FIT +) participants, colonoscopically-defined
normal versus CRA patients were compared by regression, permutation, and random
forest plus leave-one-out methods.
FINDINGS: Of 95 FIT + participants, 61 had successful fecal microbiota profiling 
and colonoscopy, identifying 24 completely normal patients, 20 CRA patients, 2
CRC patients, and 15 with other conditions. Phylum-level fecal community
composition differed significantly between CRA and normal patients (permutation
P = 0.02). Rank phylum-level abundance distinguished CRA from normal patients
(area under the curve = 0.767, permutation P = 0.006). CRA prevalence was 59% in 
phylum-level cluster B versus 20% in cluster A (exact P = 0.01). Most of the
difference reflected 3-fold higher median relative abundance of Proteobacteria
taxa (Wilcoxon signed-rank P = 0.03, positive predictive value = 67%). Antibiotic
exposure and other potential confounders did not affect the associations.
INTERPRETATION: If confirmed in larger, more diverse populations, fecal
microbiota analysis might be employed to improve screening for CRA and ultimately
to reduce mortality from CRC.

Obesity is a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), and alterations in the
colonic microbiome and metabolome may be mechanistically involved in this
relationship. The relative contribution of diet and obesity per se are unclear.
We compared the effect of diet- and genetically-induced obesity on the intestinal
microbiome and metabolome in a mouse model of CRC. Apc1638N mice were made obese 
by either high fat (HF) feeding or the presence of the Leprdb/db (DbDb) mutation.
Intestinal tumors were quantified and stool microbiome and metabolome were
profiled. Genetic obesity, and to a lesser extent HF feeding, promoted intestinal
tumorigenesis. Each induced distinct microbial patterns: taxa enriched in HF were
mostly Firmicutes (6 of 8) while those enriched in DbDb were split between
Firmicutes (7 of 12) and Proteobacteria (5 of 12). Parabecteroides distasonis was
lower in tumor-bearing mice and its abundance was inversely associated with
colonic Il1b production (p<0.05). HF and genetic obesity altered the abundance of
49 and 40 fecal metabolites respectively, with 5 in common. Of these 5, adenosine
was also lower in obese and in tumor-bearing mice (p<0.05) and its concentration 
was inversely associated with colonic Il1b and Tnf production (p<0.05). HF and
genetic obesity differentially alter the intestinal microbiome and metabolome. A 
depletion of adenosine and P.distasonis in tumor-bearing mice could play a
mechanistic role in tumor formation. Adenosine and P. distasonis have previously 
been shown to be anti-inflammatory in the colon and we postulate their reduction 
could promote tumorigenesis by de-repressing inflammation.

Studies using animal models have demonstrated that probiotics may have a
beneficial role in the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the
underlying mechanism of the beneficial effects of interventional probiotic
treatment on gut microbiota has remained elusive. In the present study,
pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes was conducted in order to
determine the extent to which probiotics alter the microbiota. The observations
of the present study indicated that the microbial structure of cancerous tissue
differed significantly from that of healthy individuals and that the CRC
microbiota exhibited lower diversity. It was indicated that interventional
treatment with probiotics increased the density and diversity of mucosal
microbes, and altered the mucosa‑associated microbiota. Pyrosequencing
demonstrated that probiotics significantly reduced (5‑fold) the abundance of a
bacterial taxon assigned to the genus Fusobacterium, which had been previously
suggested to be a contributing factor to increase tumorigenesis. Accordingly,
interventional probiotic therapy is suggested to be able to improve the
composition of the mucosal microbial flora and significantly reduce the abundance
of mucosa-associated pathogens in patients with CRC.

Introduction: Metabolomics is a valuable tool for biomarker screening of
colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we profiled the urinary metabolomes of
patients enrolled in a prospective patient cohort (ColoCare). We aimed to
describe changes in the metabolome in the longer clinical follow-up and describe 
initial predictors as candidate markers with possibly prognostic significance.
Methods: In total, 199 urine samples from CRC patients pre-surgery (n=97), 1-8
days post-surgery (n=12) and then after 6 and 12 months (n=52 and 38,
respectively) were analyzed using both GC-MS and 1H-NMR. Both datasets were
analyzed separately with built in uni- and multivariate analyses of Metaboanalyst
2.0. Furthermore, adjusted linear mixed effects regression models were
constructed.
Results: Many concentrations of the metabolites derived from the gut microbiome
were affected by CRC surgery, presumably indicating a tumor-induced shift in
bacterial species. Associations of the microbial metabolites with disease stage
indicate an important role of the gut microbiome in CRC.We were able to
differentiate the metabolite profiles of CRC patients prior to surgery from those
at any post-surgery timepoint using a multivariate model containing 20 marker
metabolites (AUCROC=0.89; 95% CI:0.84-0.95).
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first metabolomic
studies to follow CRC patients in a prospective setting with repeated urine
sampling over time. We were able to confirm markers initially identified in
case-control studies and pin point metabolites which may serve as candidates for 
prognostic biomarkers of CRC.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota influences the progression of
colitis-associated colorectal cancer. With diet being a key determinant of the
gut microbial ecology, dietary interventions are an attractive avenue for the
prevention of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Curcumin is the most active
constituent of the ground rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant, which has been
demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiproliferative
properties.
METHODS: Il10 mice on 129/SvEv background were used as a model of
colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Starting at 10 weeks of age, wild-type or
Il10 mice received 6 weekly intraperitoneal injections of azoxymethane (AOM) or
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were started on either a control or a
curcumin-supplemented diet. Stools were collected every 4 weeks for microbial
community analysis. Mice were killed at 30 weeks of age.
RESULTS: Curcumin-supplemented diet increased survival, decreased colon
weight/length ratio, and, at 0.5%, entirely eliminated tumor burden. Although
colonic histology indicated improvement with curcumin, no effects of mucosal
immune responses have been observed in PBS/Il10 mice and limited effects were
seen in AOM/Il10 mice. In wild-type and in Il10 mice, curcumin increased
bacterial richness, prevented age-related decrease in alpha diversity, increased 
the relative abundance of Lactobacillales, and decreased Coriobacterales order.
Taxonomic profile of AOM/Il10 mice receiving curcumin was more similar to those
of wild-type mice than those fed control diet.
CONCLUSIONS: In AOM/Il10 model, curcumin reduced or eliminated colonic tumor
burden with limited effects on mucosal immune responses. The beneficial effect of
curcumin on tumorigenesis was associated with the maintenance of a more diverse
colonic microbial ecology.

Colorectal cancer risk is associated with diets high in red meat. Heme, the
pigment of red meat, induces cytotoxicity of colonic contents and elicits
epithelial damage and compensatory hyperproliferation, leading to hyperplasia.
Here we explore the possible causal role of the gut microbiota in heme-induced
hyperproliferation. To this end, mice were fed a purified control or heme diet
(0.5 μmol/g heme) with or without broad-spectrum antibiotics for 14 d.
Heme-induced hyperproliferation was shown to depend on the presence of the gut
microbiota, because hyperproliferation was completely eliminated by antibiotics, 
although heme-induced luminal cytotoxicity was sustained in these mice. Colon
mucosa transcriptomics revealed that antibiotics block heme-induced differential 
expression of oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and cell turnover genes, implying
that antibiotic treatment prevented the heme-dependent cytotoxic micelles to
reach the epithelium. Our results indicate that this occurs because antibiotics
reinforce the mucus barrier by eliminating sulfide-producing bacteria and
mucin-degrading bacteria (e.g., Akkermansia). Sulfide potently reduces disulfide 
bonds and can drive mucin denaturation and microbial access to the mucus layer.
This reduction results in formation of trisulfides that can be detected in vitro 
and in vivo. Therefore, trisulfides can serve as a novel marker of colonic
mucolysis and thus as a proxy for mucus barrier reduction. In feces, antibiotics 
drastically decreased trisulfides but increased mucin polymers that can be lysed 
by sulfide. We conclude that the gut microbiota is required for heme-induced
epithelial hyperproliferation and hyperplasia because of the capacity to reduce
mucus barrier function.

Here, we show that autophagy is activated in the intestinal epithelium in murine 
and human colorectal cancer and that the conditional inactivation of Atg7 in
intestinal epithelial cells inhibits the formation of pre-cancerous lesions in
Apc(+/-) mice by enhancing anti-tumour responses. The antibody-mediated depletion
of CD8(+) T cells showed that these cells are essential for the anti-tumoral
responses mediated by the inhibition of autophagy. We show that Atg7 deficiency
leads to intestinal dysbiosis and that the microbiota is required for anticancer 
responses. In addition, Atg7 deficiency resulted in a stress response accompanied
by metabolic defects, AMPK activation and p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest in
tumour cells but not in normal tissue. This study reveals that the inhibition of 
autophagy within the epithelium may prevent the development and progression of
colorectal cancer in genetically predisposed patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a growing cause of mortality in developing countries, 
warranting investigation into its etiopathogenesis and earlier diagnosis. Here,
we investigated the fecal metabolic phenotype of patients with advanced
colorectal neoplasia and controls using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy and multivariate modeling. The fecal microbiota composition was
assessed by quantitative real-time PCR as well as Wif-1 methylation levels in
stools, serum, and urine and correlated to the metabolic profile of each patient.
The predictivity of the model was 0.507 (Q(2)Y), and the explained variance was
0.755 (R(2)Y). Patients with advanced colorectal neoplasia demonstrated increased
fecal concentrations of four short-chain fatty acids (valerate, acetate,
propionate, and butyrate) and decreased signals relating to β-glucose, glutamine,
and glutamate. The predictive accuracy of the multivariate (1)H NMR model was
higher than that of the guaiac-fecal occult blood test and the Wif-1 methylation 
test for predicting advanced colorectal neoplasia. Correlation analysis between
fecal metabolites and bacterial profiles revealed strong associations between
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium leptum species with short-chain
fatty acids concentration and inverse correlation between Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii and glucose. These preliminary results suggest that fecal
metabonomics may potentially have a future role in a noninvasive colorectal
screening program and may contribute to our understanding of the role of these
dysregulated molecules in the cross-talk between the host and its bacterial
microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of death worldwide.
Chronic gut inflammation is recognized as a risk factor for tumor development,
including CRC. American ginseng is a very commonly used ginseng species in the
West.
METHODS: A genetically engineered Apc (Min/+) mouse model was used in this study.
We analyzed the saponin composition of American ginseng used in this project, and
evaluated its effects on the progression of high-fat-diet-enhanced CRC
carcinogenesis.
RESULTS: After oral ginseng administration (10-20 mg/kg/d for up to 32 wk),
experimental data showed that, compared with the untreated mice, ginseng very
significantly reduced tumor initiation and progression in both the small
intestine (including the proximal end, middle end, and distal end) and the colon 
(all p < 0.01). This tumor number reduction was more obvious in those mice
treated with a low dose of ginseng. The tumor multiplicity data were supported by
body weight changes and gut tissue histology examinations. In addition,
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that compared
with the untreated group, ginseng very significantly reduced the gene expression 
of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-1β, IL-6, tumor
necrosis factor-α, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in both the small intestine and 
the colon (all p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to link our observed effects to the
actions of the gut microbiome in converting the parent ginsenosides to bioactive 
ginseng metabolites. Our data suggest that American ginseng may have potential
value in CRC chemoprevention.

The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to a variety of chemicals and 
commensal bacteria. Recent studies have shown that changes in gut microbial
populations caused by chlorine or other chemicals in the drinking water influence
the development of human colorectal cancer, although the mechanism of
tumorigenesis in the gut epithelium is obfuscated by the diversity of microflora 
and complexity of the tumor microenvironment. In this regard, mouse models that
recapitulate human colorectal cancer are an invaluable tool. In this study, we
used two conditional adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) knockout mouse models to
investigate the effect of chlorinated water on tumorigenesis in the digestive
tract. Mice with colon-specific carcinoma--caused by either chromosomal (CDX2P
9.5-NLS Cre;Apc(+/flox), abbreviated to CPC;Apc) or microsatellite
(CDX2P9.5-G19Cre;Apc(flox/flox) and CDX2P9.5-G22Cre;Apc(flox/flox)) instability, 
respectively--were administered chlorinated (10.0 mg/L chlorine) or tap (0.7 mg/L
chlorine) water and evaluated for colon polyp formation. In CPC;Apc mice given
chlorinated drinking water, tumors tended to develop in the colon, whereas in
those that drank tap water, tumors were mostly observed in the small intestine.
There was no difference in the rate of tumor formation of
CDX2P9.5-G19Cre;Apc(flox/flox) and CDX2P9.5-G22Cre;Apc(flox/flox) mice consuming 
chlorinated as compared to tap water, suggesting that microsatellite instability 
in the Apc gene does not significantly affect tumorigenesis. Chlorinated water
altered the enteric environment by reducing the fecal populations of the
obligatory anaerobes Clostridium perfringens and C. difficile, as well as species
belonging to the Atopobium cluster, including Enterobacteriaceae and
Staphylococcus sp., which was associated with colon tumorigenesis in CPC;Apc
mice. These results suggest that differences in tumorigenesis among CPC;Apc mice 
consuming chlorinated versus tap water may be due to differences in
gastrointestinal commensal populations.

The Roles of Inflammation, Nutrient Availability and the Commensal Microbiota in 
Enteric Pathogen Infection.

Stecher B.

The healthy human intestine is colonized by as many as 1014 bacteria belonging to
more than 500 different species forming a microbial ecosystem of unsurpassed
diversity, termed the microbiota. The microbiota's various bacterial members
engage in a physiological network of cooperation and competition within several
layers of complexity. Within the last 10 years, technological progress in the
field of next-generation sequencing technologies has tremendously advanced our
understanding of the wide variety of physiological and pathological processes
that are influenced by the commensal microbiota (1, 2). An increasing number of
human disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type 2
diabetes, obesity, allergies and colorectal cancer are linked with altered
microbiota composition (3). Moreover, a clearer picture is emerging of the
composition of the human microbiota in healthy individuals, its variability over 
time and between different persons and how the microbiota is shaped by
environmental factors (i.e., diet) and the host's genetic background (4). A
general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in
the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed
colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be
transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high
levels. This disruption can be caused by exposure to antibiotics (5, 6), changes 
in diet (7, 8), application of probiotics and drugs (9), and a variety of
diseases (3). Breakdown of CR can boost colonization by intrinsic pathogens or
increase susceptibility to infections (10). One consequence of pathogen expansion
is the triggering of inflammatory host responses and pathogen-mediated disease.
Interestingly, human enteric pathogens are part of a small group of bacterial
families that belong to the Proteobacteria: the Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli,
Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.), the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio
cholerae) and the Campylobacteriaceae (Campylobacter spp.). In general, members
of these families (be it commensals or pathogens) only constitute a minority of
the intestinal microbiota. However, proteobacterial "blooms" are a characteristic
trait of an abnormal microbiota such as in the course of antibiotic therapy,
dietary changes or inflammation (11). It has become clear that the gut microbiota
not only plays a major role in priming and regulating mucosal and systemic
immunity, but that the immune system also contributes to host control over
microbiota composition. These two ways of mutual communication between the
microbiota and the immune system were coined as "outside-in" and "inside-out,"
respectively (12). The significance of those interactions for human health is
particularly evident in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The
symptoms of these recurrent, chronic types of gut inflammation are caused by an
excessive immune response against one's own commensal microbiota (13). It is
assumed that deregulated immune responses can be caused by a genetic
predisposition, leading to, for example, the impairment of intestinal barrier
function or disruption of mucosal T-cell homeostasis. In CD or UC patients, an
abnormally composed microbiota, referred to as "dysbiosis," is commonly observed 
(discussed later). This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance
of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at
the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes
Bacteroidia and Clostridia. So far, it is unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or
a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, both scenarios are
equally conceivable. Recent work suggests that inflammatory immune responses in
the gut (both IBD and pathogen-induced) can alter the gut luminal milieu in a way
that favors dysbiosis (14). In this chapter, I present a survey on our current
state of understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms underlying gut
inflammation-associated dysbiosis. The role of dysbiosis in enteric infections

pathogens and the gut microbiota in the inflamed gut and the role of dysbiotic
microbiota alterations (e.g., "Enterobacterial blooms" (11)) for the evolution of
pathogenicity.

IMPORTANCE: Evidence indicates a complex link between gut microbiome, immunity,
and intestinal tumorigenesis. To target the microbiota and immunity for
colorectal cancer prevention and therapy, a better understanding of the
relationship between microorganisms and immune cells in the tumor
microenvironment is needed. Experimental evidence suggests that Fusobacterium
nucleatum may promote colonic neoplasia development by downregulating antitumor T
cell-mediated adaptive immunity.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a greater amount of F nucleatum in
colorectal carcinoma tissue is associated with a lower density of T cells in
tumor tissue.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on
598 rectal and colon carcinoma cases in 2 US nationwide prospective cohort
studies with follow-up through 2006, the Nurses' Health Study (participants
enrolled in 1976) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (participants
enrolled in 1986). Tissue collection and processing were performed from 2002
through 2008, and immunity assessment, 2008 through 2009. From 2013 through 2014,
the amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue was measured by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay; we equally dichotomized positive
cases (high vs low). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was
conducted in 2014 to assess associations of the amount of F nucleatum with
densities (quartiles) of T cells in tumor tissue, controlling for clinical and
tumor molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island
methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1)
methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation status. We adjusted the 2-sided 
α level to .013 for multiple hypothesis testing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Densities of CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO (protein tyrosine
phosphatase receptor type C [PTPRC])+, and FOXP3+ T cells in tumor tissue,
determined by means of tissue microarray immunohistochemical analysis and
computer-assisted image analysis.
RESULTS: F nucleatum was detected in colorectal carcinoma tissue in 76 (13%) of
598 cases. Compared with F nucleatum-negative cases, F nucleatum-high cases were 
inversely associated with the density of CD3+ T cells (for a unit increase in
quartile categories of CD3+ T cells as an outcome: multivariable odds ratio, 0.47
[95% CI, 0.26-0.87]; P for trend = .006). The amount of F nucleatum was not
significantly associated with the density of CD8+, CD45RO+, or FOXP3+ T cells (P 
fortrend = .24, .88, and .014, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The amount of tissue F nucleatum is inversely
associated with CD3+ T-cell density in colorectal carcinoma tissue. On
validation, our human population data may provide an impetus for further
investigations on potential interactive roles of Fusobacterium and host immunity 
in colon carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: The human gut microbiome is associated with the development of colon 
cancer, and recent studies have found changes in the microbiome in cancer
patients compared to healthy controls. Studying the microbial communities in the 
tumor microenvironment may shed light on the role of host-bacteria interactions
in colorectal cancer. Here, we highlight the major shifts in the colorectal tumor
microbiome relative to that of matched normal colon tissue from the same
individual, allowing us to survey the microbial communities in the tumor
microenvironment and providing intrinsic control for environmental and host
genetic effects on the microbiome.
METHODS: We sequenced the microbiome in 44 primary tumor and 44 patient-matched
normal colon tissue samples to determine differentially abundant microbial taxa
These data were also used to functionally characterize the microbiome of the
cancer and normal sample pairs and identify functional pathways enriched in the
tumor-associated microbiota.
RESULTS: We find that tumors harbor distinct microbial communities compared to
nearby healthy tissue. Our results show increased microbial diversity in the
tumor microenvironment, with changes in the abundances of commensal and
pathogenic bacterial taxa, including Fusobacterium and Providencia. While
Fusobacterium has previously been implicated in colorectal cancer, Providencia is
a novel tumor-associated agent which has not been identified in previous studies.
Additionally, we identified a clear, significant enrichment of predicted
virulence-associated genes in the colorectal cancer microenvironment, likely
dependent upon the genomes of Fusobacterium and Providencia.
CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies bacterial taxa significantly correlated with
colorectal cancer, including a novel finding of an elevated abundance of
Providencia in the tumor microenvironment. We also describe the predicted
metabolic pathways and enzymes differentially present in the tumor-associated
microbiome, and show an enrichment of virulence-associated bacterial genes in the
tumor microenvironment. This predicted virulence enrichment supports the
hypothesis that the microbiome plays an active role in colorectal cancer
development and/or progression. Our results provide a starting point for future
prognostic and therapeutic research with the potential to improve patient
outcomes.

Cholecystectomy, surgical removal of the gallbladder, changes bile flow to the
intestine and can therefore alter the bidirectional interactions between bile
acids (BAs) and the intestinal microbiota. We quantified and correlated BAs and
bacterial community composition in gallstone patients scheduled for
cholecystectomy before and after the procedure, using gas-liquid chromatography
and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, followed by quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction of the phylum Bacteroidetes. Gallstone patients had higher overall
concentrations of faecal BAs and a decreased microbial diversity, accompanied by 
a reduction in the beneficial genus Roseburia and an enrichment of the
uncultivated genus Oscillospira, compared with controls. These two genera may
thus serve as biomarkers for symptomatic gallstone formation. Oscillospira was
correlated positively with secondary BAs and negatively with primary BAs, while
the phylum Bacteroidetes showed an opposite trend. Cholecystectomy resulted in no
substantial change in patients' faecal BAs. However, bacterial composition was
significantly altered, with a significant increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes.
Given that cholecystectomy has been associated with a higher risk of colorectal
cancer and that members of the Bacteroidetes are increased in that disease,
microbial consequences of cholecystectomy should be further explored.

The microbiome is the collective term used to describe the bacteria, viruses,
fungi and archaea that reside on and in the human body. The majority of these
organisms are found within the large bowel. Mounting evidence suggests that
changes in the microbiome may be associated with the development of colorectal
cancer, a disease which affects 1.3 million people a year worldwide. Using
colorectal cancer as an example, this article presents the inter-specialty
collaborative approach to microbiome research and discusses the key role that
clinical biochemistry is likely to play.

SCOPE: MicroRNAs (miRs) are proposed as colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarkers.
Pomegranate ellagic acid and their microbiota metabolites urolithins exert
anticancer effects in preclinical CRC models, and target normal and malignant
colon tissues in CRC patients. Herein, we investigated whether the intake of
pomegranate extract (PE) modified miRs expression in surgical colon tissues
versus biopsies from CRC patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.
Thirty-five CRC patients consumed 900 mg PE daily before surgery. Control CRC
patients (no PE intake, n = 10) were included. Our results revealed: (1)
significant differences for specific miRs between malignant and normal tissues
modifiable by the surgical protocols; (2) opposed trends between -5p and -3p
isomolecules; (3) general induction of miRs attributable to the surgery; (4)
moderate modulation of various miRs following the PE intake, and (5) no
association between tissue urolithins and the observed miRs changes.
CONCLUSION: PE consumption appears to affect specific colon tissue miRs but
surgery critically alters miRs levels hindering the discrimination of significant
changes caused by dietary factors and the establishment of genuine differences
between malignant and normal tissues as biomarkers. The components responsible
for the PE effects and the clinical relevance of these observations deserve
further research.

A genome-wide systems analysis reveals strong link between colorectal cancer and 
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbial metabolite of dietary meat and
fat.

Xu R, Wang Q, Li L.

BACKGROUND: Dietary intakes of red meat and fat are established risk factors for 
both colorectal cancer (CRC) and cardiovascular disease (CVDs). Recent studies
have shown a mechanistic link between TMAO, an intestinal microbial metabolite of
red meat and fat, and risk of CVDs. Data linking TMAO directly to CRC is,
however, lacking. Here, we present an unbiased data-driven network-based systems 
approach to uncover a potential genetic relationship between TMAO and CRC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed two different epigenetic interaction
networks (EINs) using chemical-gene, disease-gene and protein-protein interaction
data from multiple large-scale data resources. We developed a network-based
ranking algorithm to ascertain TMAO-related diseases from EINs. We systematically
analyzed disease categories among TMAO-related diseases at different ranking
cutoffs. We then determined which genetic pathways were associated with both TMAO
and CRC.
RESULTS: We show that CVDs and their major risk factors were ranked highly among 
TMAO-related diseases, confirming the newly discovered mechanistic link between
CVDs and TMAO, and thus validating our algorithms. CRC was ranked highly among
TMAO-related disease retrieved from both EINs (top 0.02%, #1 out of 4,372
diseases retrieved based on Mendelian genetics and top 10.9% among 882 diseases
based on genome-wide association genetics), providing strong supporting evidence 
for our hypothesis that TMAO is genetically related to CRC. We have also
identified putative genetic pathways that may link TMAO to CRC, which warrants
further investigation. Through systematic disease enrichment analysis, we also
demonstrated that TMAO is related to metabolic syndromes and cancers in general.
CONCLUSIONS: Our genome-wide analysis demonstrates that systems approaches to
studying the epigenetic interactions among diet, microbiome metabolisms, and
disease genetics hold promise for understanding disease pathogenesis. Our results
show that TMAO is genetically associated with CRC. This study suggests that TMAO 
may be an important intermediate marker linking dietary meat and fat and gut
microbiota metabolism to risk of CRC, underscoring opportunities for the
development of new gut microbiome-dependent diagnostic tests and therapeutics for
CRC.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Mutations in the
innate immune sensor AIM2 are frequently identified in patients with colorectal
cancer, but how AIM2 modulates colonic tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we found
that Aim2-deficient mice were hypersusceptible to colonic tumor development.
Production of inflammasome-associated cytokines and other inflammatory mediators 
was largely intact in Aim2-deficient mice; however, intestinal stem cells were
prone to uncontrolled proliferation. Aberrant Wnt signaling expanded a population
of tumor-initiating stem cells in the absence of AIM2. Susceptibility of
Aim2-deficient mice to colorectal tumorigenesis was enhanced by a dysbiotic gut
microbiota, which was reduced by reciprocal exchange of gut microbiota with
healthy wild-type mice. These findings uncover a synergy between a specific host 
genetic factor and gut microbiota in determining the susceptibility to colorectal
cancer. Therapeutic modulation of AIM2 expression and microbiota has the
potential to prevent colorectal cancer.

Epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk
with high red meat (HRM) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be
protective. In the present study, we examined whether a HRM diet increased rectal
O(6)-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (O(6)MeG) adduct levels in healthy human subjects,
and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (HAMSB) was protective. A group
of twenty-three individuals consumed 300 g/d of cooked red meat without (HRM
diet) or with 40 g/d of HAMSB (HRM+HAMSB diet) over 4-week periods separated by a
4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. Stool and rectal biopsy samples
were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at
baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. The HRM diet
increased rectal O(6)MeG adducts relative to its baseline by 21% (P < 0.01),
whereas the addition of HAMSB to the HRM diet prevented this increase. Epithelial
proliferation increased with both the HRM (P < 0.001) and HRM + HAMSB (P < 0.05) 
diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower
following the HRM + HAMSB diet compared with the HRM diet (P < 0.05). Relative to
its baseline, the HRM + HAMSB diet increased the excretion of SCFA by over 20% (P
< 0.05) and increased the absolute abundances of the Clostridium coccoides group 
(P < 0.05), the Clostridium leptum group (P < 0.05), Lactobacillus spp. (P <
0.01), Parabacteroides distasonis (P < 0.001) and Ruminococcus bromii (P < 0.05),
but lowered Ruminococcus torques (P < 0.05) and the proportions of Ruminococcus
gnavus, Ruminococcus torques and Escherichia coli (P < 0.01). HRM consumption
could increase the risk of CRC through increased formation of colorectal
epithelial O(6)MeG adducts. HAMSB consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct
formation, which may be associated with increased stool SCFA levels and/or
changes in the microbiota composition.

Uncured and nitrite-cured pork were subjected, raw, cooked (65 °C, 15 min) or
overcooked (90 °C, 30 min), to an in vitro digestion model, which includes mouth,
stomach, duodenum, and colon phases. Heating of uncured meat resulted in a
pronounced increase in lipid and protein oxidation products throughout digestion.
Nitrite-curing had an antioxidant effect during digestion, but this effect
disappeared when the meat was overcooked, resulting in up to ninefold higher
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal concentrations compared with digested nitrite-cured raw and
cooked pork. Colonic digesta contained significantly higher concentrations of the
NOC-specific DNA adduct O(6)-carboxy-methylguanine when pork underwent a more
intense heating procedure, independent of nitrite-curing, depending strongly on
the fecal inoculum used. Since processed meats are usually nitrite-cured, the
present study suggests that overcooking processed meat is likely to result in the
formation of genotoxic compounds during digestion and should, therefore, be
avoided.

Members of the human microbiota are increasingly being correlated to human health
and disease states, but the majority of the underlying microbial metabolites that
regulate host-microbe interactions remain largely unexplored. Select strains of
Escherichia coli present in the human colon have been linked to the initiation of
inflammation-induced colorectal cancer through an unknown small-molecule-mediated
process. The responsible non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide hybrid pathway encodes 
'colibactin', which belongs to a largely uncharacterized family of small
molecules. Genotoxic small molecules from this pathway that are capable of
initiating cancer formation have remained elusive due to their high instability. 
Guided by metabolomic analyses, here we employ a combination of NMR spectroscopy 
and bioinformatics-guided isotopic labelling studies to characterize the
colibactin warhead, an unprecedented substituted spirobicyclic structure. The
warhead crosslinks duplex DNA in vitro, providing direct experimental evidence
for colibactin's DNA-damaging activity. The data support unexpected models for
both colibactin biosynthesis and its mode of action.

Obesity is a fast-emerging epidemic in the Asia-Pacific region, with numbers
paralleling the rising global prevalence within the past 30 years. The landscape 
of gut diseases in Asia has been drastically changed by obesity. In addition to
more non-specific abdominal symptoms, obesity is the cause of gastro-oesophageal 
reflux disease, various gastrointestinal cancers (colorectal cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia
adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer and gallbladder cancer) and non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease. Abnormal cross-talk between the gut microbiome and the obese host 
seems to play a central role in the pathogenesis, but more studies are needed.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world and the
second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US and Spain. The molecular
mechanisms involved in the etiology of CRC are not yet elucidated due in part to 
the complexity of the human gut microbiota. In this study, we compared the
microbiome composition of 90 tumor and matching adjacent tissue (adjacent) from
cohorts from the US and Spain by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in order to
determine the impact of the geographic origin on the CRC microbiome. Data showed 
a significantly (P < 0.05) higher Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) for the US (PD
Adjacent = 26.3 ± 5.3, PD Tumor = 23.3 ± 6.2) compared to the Spanish cohort (PD 
Adjacent = 18.9 ± 5.9, PD Tumor = 18.7 ± 6.6) while no significant differences in
bacterial diversity were observed between tumor and adjacent tissues for
individuals from the same country. Adjacent tissues from the Spanish cohort were 
enriched in Firmicutes (SP = 43.9% and US = 22.2%, P = 0.0001) and Actinobacteria
(SP = 1.6% and US = 0.5%, P = 0.0018) compared to US adjacent tissues, while
adjacent tissues from the US had significantly higher abundances of Fusobacteria 
(US = 8.1% and SP = 1.5%, P = 0.0023) and Sinergistetes (US = 0.3% and SP = 0.1%,
P = 0.0097). Comparisons between tumor and adjacent tissues in each cohort
identified the genus Eikenella significantly over represented in US tumors (T =
0.024% and A = 0%, P = 0.03), and the genera Fusobacterium (T = 10.4% and A =
1.5%, P = <0.0001), Bulleida (T = 0.36% and A = 0.09%, P = 0.02), Gemella (T =
1.46% and A = 0.19%, P = 0.03), Parvimonas (T = 3.14% and A = 0.86%, P = 0.03),
Campylobacter (T = 0.15% and A = 0.008%, P = 0.047), and Streptococcus (T = 2.84%
and A = 2.19%, P = 0.05) significantly over represented in Spanish tumors.
Predicted metagenome functional content from 16S rRNA surveys showed that
bacterial motility proteins and proteins involved in flagellar assembly were over
represented in adjacent tissues of both cohorts, while pathways involved in fatty
acid biosynthesis, the MAPK signaling pathway, and bacterial toxins were over
represented in tumors. Our study suggests that microbiome compositional and
functional dissimilarities by geographic location should be taken in
consideration when approaching CRC therapeutic options.

Modification of microflora imbalance: future directions for prevention and
treatment of colorectal cancer?

Ciernikova S, Mego M, Hainova K, Adamcikova Z, Stevurkova V, Zajac V.

Increasing incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer brings the necessity to
uncover new possibilities in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The
microbiome as the collective genetic material of the microflora, overexceed the
number of genes in the human genome and is unique for each individual. Due to the
benefits providing for the host and mainly for immediate interaction with the
host immune system, a gastrointestinal microflora can be considered "cardinal
microbiome". Host-microbial relations includes symbiotic, pathogenic and
competitive interactions. Causal role of gastrointestinal microflora in
colorectal carcinogenesis is still not well determined. This minireview is
focused on current evidence in understanding the role of bacteria in colorectal
carcinogenesis, the impact of bacterial dysbiosis on tumor formation, and ability
of probiotics and bacterial vectors to modulate the gastrointestinal microflora
as prevention and therapy tool in colorectal cancer.

The ellagic acid-derived gut microbiota metabolite, urolithin A, potentiates the 
anticancer effects of 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy on human colon cancer cells.

Chemotherapy increases the overall survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. 
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) remains as a drug of first choice in CRC therapy over the
last four decades. However, only 10-15% of patients with advanced CRC respond
positively to 5-FU monotherapy. Therefore, new strategies to enhance the 5-FU
effectiveness, overcome the tumor cell resistance and decrease the unspecific
toxicity are critically needed. Urolithin A (Uro-A) is the main metabolite
produced by the human gut microbiota from the dietary polyphenol ellagic acid.
Uro-A targets the colonic mucosa of CRC patients, and preclinical studies have
shown the anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive activities of this
metabolite. We evaluated here whether Uro-A, at concentrations achievable in the 
human colorectum, could sensitize colon cancer cells to 5-FU and 5'DFUR (a
pro-drug intermediate of 5-FU). We found that both 5-FU and 5'DFUR arrested the
cell cycle at the S phase by regulating cyclins A and B1 in the human colon
cancer cells Caco-2, SW-480 and HT-29, and also triggered apoptosis through the
activation of caspases 8 and 9. Co-treatments with Uro-A decreased IC50 values
for both 5-FU and 5'DFUR and additionally arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M
phase together with a slight increase in caspases 8 and 9 activation. Overall, we
show that Uro-A potentiated the effects of both 5-FU and 5'DFUR on colon cancer
cells. This suggests the need for lower 5-FU doses to achieve similar effects,
which could reduce possible adverse effects. Further in vivo investigations are
warranted to explore the possible role of Uro-A as a chemotherapy adjuvant.

PURPOSE: Gut microbiota has been postulated to serve as a significant promoter of
CRC formation, and colonic dysbiosis was previously reported in CRC tissue. Our
aim was to evaluate the association between the type and cumulative duration of
antibiotic exposure and CRC risk.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study using a large population-based 
database from the UK. Cases were defined as those with any medical code of CRC.
Subjects with known familial CRC syndromes or IBD were excluded from the study.
For every case, four eligible controls matched on age, sex, practice site, and
duration of follow-up before index date were selected using incidence-density
sampling. Exposure of interest was antibiotic therapy before index date. Adjusted
ORs and 95%CIs were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 20,990 cases and 82,054 controls were identified. The
adjusted OR for CRC among subjects first exposed to penicillins >10 years prior
to index date was 1.11 (95%CI 1.02-1.20). The risk increased significantly with
the number of penicillin exposures up to 1.20 (95%CI 1.11-1.31) for >10 courses. 
The risk also increased with the average number of penicillin treatments per-year
(exposure intensity) with an OR of 1.04 (95%CI 1.01-1.08) per one additional
treatment per year. Exposure to anti-viral or anti-fungal therapy was not
associated with CRC risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Past exposure to multiple courses of penicillins is related to a
modest elevation in CRC risk.

Chikungunya's phenomenal dissemination imposes now infection suspicion when
returning from endemic areas. Colorectal cancer screening may be dependent of the
microbiome. Even a small amount of E. coli in catheter sampled urine is
predictive for a urinary infection. Prevention of pharyngitis suppurated late
complications doesn't justify systematic antimicrobial therapy. A bitherapy is
probably better for severe community acquired pneumonias. Due to epidemiology and
resistances, management of gonorrhoea has changed. Enterovirus 68 is particular
because of its almost exclusive lung tropism in children. The question is no
longer how to treat hepatitis C but which patients to treat and when. Pritelivir 
clearly improves herpes genitalis symptoms. The first confirmed case of Ebola has
reach our contry.

Recently, bacterial infection causing periodontal disease has attracted
considerable attention as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Fusobacterium
species is an oral bacterial group of the human microbiome. Some evidence
suggests that Fusobacterium species promote colorectal cancer development;
however, no previous studies have reported the association between Fusobacterium 
species and pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we examined whether Fusobacterium
species exist in pancreatic cancer tissue. Using a database of 283 patients with 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we tested cancer tissue specimens for
Fusobacterium species. We also tested the specimens for KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and
PIK3CA mutations and measured microRNA-21 and microRNA-31. In addition, we
assessed epigenetic alterations, including CpG island methylator phenotype
(CIMP). Our data showed an 8.8% detection rate of Fusobacterium species in
pancreatic cancers; however, tumor Fusobacterium status was not associated with
any clinical and molecular features. In contrast, in multivariate Cox regression 
analysis, compared with the Fusobacterium species-negative group, we observed
significantly higher cancer-specific mortality rates in the positive group (p =
0.023). In conclusion, Fusobacterium species were detected in pancreatic cancer
tissue. Tumor Fusobacterium species status is independently associated with a
worse prognosis of pancreatic cancer, suggesting that Fusobacterium species may
be a prognostic biomarker of pancreatic cancer.

AIM: To investigate differences in microbes and short chain fatty acid (SCFA)
levels in stool samples from Hispanic and non-Hispanic African American, American
Indian, and White participants.
METHODS: Stool samples from twenty participants were subjected to analysis for
relative levels of viable bacteria and for SCFA levels. Additionally, the samples
were subjected to 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing for identification of bacteria
present in the stool. We used a metagenome functional prediction technique to
analyze genome copy numbers and estimate the abundance of butyrate kinase in all 
samples.
RESULTS: We found that African Americans had significantly lower levels of
acetate, butyrate, and total SCFAs than all other racial/ethnic groups. We also
found that participant microbial profiles differed by racial/ethnic group.
African Americans had significantly more Firmicutes than Whites, with enriched
Ruminococcaceae. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was also significantly higher
for African Americans than for Whites (P = 0.049). We found Clostridium levels to
be significantly and inversely related to total SCFA levels (P = 0.019) and we
found Bacteroides to be positively associated (P = 0.027) and Clostridium to be
negatively associated (P = 0.012) with levels of butyrate. We also identified a
correlation between copy number for a butyrate kinase predicted from 16S rRNA
gene abundance and levels of butyrate in stool.
CONCLUSION: The identified differences in gut flora and SCFA levels may relate to
colorectal cancer mortality differentials and may be useful as targets for future
clinical and behavioral interventions.

Colorectal cancer, a commonly diagnosed cancer in the elderly, often develops
slowly from benign polyps called adenoma. The gut microbiota is believed to be
directly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The identity and functional
capacity of the adenoma- or carcinoma-related gut microbe(s), however, have not
been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Here we perform a metagenome-wide
association study (MGWAS) on stools from advanced adenoma and carcinoma patients 
and from healthy subjects, revealing microbial genes, strains and functions
enriched in each group. An analysis of potential risk factors indicates that high
intake of red meat relative to fruits and vegetables appears to associate with
outgrowth of bacteria that might contribute to a more hostile gut environment.
These findings suggest that faecal microbiome-based strategies may be useful for 
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal adenoma or carcinoma.

OBJECTIVES: The appendix may modulate colon microbiota and bowel inflammation. We
investigated whether appendectomy alters colorectal cancer risk.
METHODS: We identified a cohort of 75,979 patients who underwent appendectomy
between 1997 and 1999 based on the insurance claims of Taiwan. A comparison
cohort of 303,640 persons without appendectomy was selected randomly, frequency
matched by age, sex, comorbidity and entry year was also selected. We monitored
subsequent colorectal cancer development in both cohorts.
RESULTS: The overall colorectal cancer incidence was 14% higher in the
appendectomy patients than in the comparison cohort (p <0.05): the highest
incidence was observed for rectal cancer, and the lowest incidence was observed
for cancer of the cecum-ascending colon for both cohorts. Men were at higher risk
than women. Subjects ≥ 60 years had an HR of 12.8 compared to those <60 years.
The incidence of colorectal cancer was much higher in 1.5-3.5 years post
appendectomy follow-up than for the comparisons (HR of 2.13). Patients who
received an incidental appendectomy had an HR of 2.90 when compared to the
comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of our study suggest that appendectomy in patients with
appendicitis is likely associated with the development of colorectal cancer in
the post-surgery period.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major burden of public health and
healthcare worldwide. Microbiota has been suggested in promoting chronic
inflammation in the intestine which, in turn, promotes tumor development. This
study focuses on possible correlations of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
with proinflammatory Stat3 signaling activities and the resulting levels of its
downstream proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 in CRC patients.
METHODS: HPV was examined using HPV Genotyping Chip technology and constitutively
active Stat3 (p-Stat3) and IL-17 levels were tested using immunohistochemistry
(IHC) in paraffin-embedded cancerous and adjacent normal tissues (ANT) from a
cohort of 95 CRC patients. Correlation analyses were performed between HPV
infection and clinicopathological characteristics, Stat3 activities and IL-17
levels among these CRC patients.
RESULTS: Three major findings were observed: (1) HPV infection existed in a high 
rate of CRC cases (48.4%, 46/95), of which 45 cases (45/46, 97.8%) were high-risk
HPV16-positive and only one case was HPV53-positive. (2) HPV infection correlated
with poorer clinical stages (III+IV) of CRC. (3) HPV infection strongly
correlated with both constitutively higher Stat3 activities (P<0.01) and higher
IL-17 levels (P<0.01) only in CRC tissues but not in ANT tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV infection is common in CRC patients suggesting potentially
preventive effectiveness of HPV vaccination among high-risk young individuals. We
have for the first time revealed a tri-lateral relationship among HPV infection, 
constitutive Stat3 activity and IL-17 level, whose collaborative act may
orchestrate a proinflammatory microenvironment in the colorectum that, in turn,
may promote carcinogenesis and possibly facilitate progression of CRC.

The dysbiosis of the human intestinal microbiota is linked to sporadic colorectal
carcinoma (CRC). The present study was designed to investigate the gut microbiota
distribution features in CRC patients. We performed pyrosequencing based analysis
of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region to investigate microbiota of the cancerous tissue 
and adjacent non-cancerous normal tissue in proximal and distal CRC samples. The 
results revealed that the microbial structures of the CRC patients and healthy
individuals differed significantly. Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were
over-represented whereas Proteobacteria was under-represented in CRC patients. In
addition, Lactococcus and Fusobacterium exhibited a relatively higher abundance
while Pseudomonas and Escherichia-Shigella was reduced in cancerous tissues
compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Meanwhile, the overall microbial
structures of proximal and distal colon cancerous tissues were similar; but
certain potential pro-oncogenic pathogens were different. These results suggested
that the mucosa-associated microbiota is dynamically associated with CRC, which
may provide evidences for microbiota-associated diagnostic, prognostic,
preventive, and therapeutic strategies for CRC.

Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in disease, including many cancer
types, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Because germline and somatic
mutations in the genes that are responsible for DNA methylation are infrequent in
malignancies, additional mechanisms must be considered. Mycoplasmas spp.,
including Mycoplasma hyorhinis, efficiently colonize human cells and may serve as
a vehicle for delivery of enzymatically active microbial proteins into the
intracellular milieu. Here, we performed, for the first time, genome-wide and
individual gene mapping of methylation marks generated by the M. hyorhinis CG-
and GATC-specific DNA cytosine methyltransferases (MTases) in human cells. Our
results demonstrated that, upon expression in human cells, MTases readily
translocated to the cell nucleus. In the nucleus, MTases selectively and
efficiently methylated the host genome at the DNA sequence sites free from
pre-existing endogenous methylation, including those in a variety of
cancer-associated genes. We also established that mycoplasma is widespread in
colorectal cancers, suggesting that either the infection contributed to
malignancy onset or, alternatively, that tumors provide a favorable environment
for mycoplasma growth. In the human genome, ∼ 11% of GATC sites overlap with CGs 
(e.g., CGAT(m)CG); therefore, the methylated status of these sites can be
perpetuated by human DNMT1. Based on these results, we now suggest that the
GATC-specific methylation represents a novel type of infection-specific
epigenetic mark that originates in human cells with a previous exposure to
infection. Overall, our findings unveil an entirely new panorama of interactions 
between the human microbiome and epigenome with a potential impact in disease
etiology.

Heat-stabilized rice bran (SRB) has been shown to regulate blood lipids and
glucose, modulate gut mucosal immunity and inhibit colorectal cancer in animal
and human studies. However, SRB's effects on gut microbial composition and
metabolism and the resulting implications for health remain largely unknown. A
pilot, randomized-controlled trial was developed to investigate the effects of
eating 30 g/day SRB on the stool microbiome and metabolome. Seven healthy
participants consumed a study meal and snack daily for 28 days. The microbiome
and metabolome were characterized using 454 pyrosequencing and gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at baseline, two and four weeks
post-intervention. Increases in eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs),
including three from Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus genera, were observed after
two and four weeks of SRB consumption (p<0.01). Branched chain fatty acids,
secondary bile acids and eleven other putative microbial metabolites were
significantly elevated in the SRB group after four weeks. The largest metabolite 
change was a rice bran component, indole-2-carboxylic acid, which showed a mean
12% increase with SRB consumption. These data support the feasibility of dietary 
SRB intervention in adults and support that SRB consumption can affect gut
microbial metabolism. These findings warrant future investigations of larger
cohorts evaluating SRB's effects on intestinal health.

The gut microbiota has an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Dejea and
colleagues have demonstrated that particular bacterial biofilms are associated
with proximal CRC, correlating with changes in tissue biology associated with
oncogenesis. These findings provide a fresh perspective on the microbiota in
cancer: microbial organization might provide critical insight into understanding 
CRC development.

Although predominantly associated with health benefits, the gut microbiota has
also been shown to harbor genes that promote inflammation. In this work, we
report a method for the direct detection and quantification of these
pro-inflammatory bacterial genes by PCR and qPCR in DNA extracted from human
stool samples. PCR reactions were performed to detect (i) the pks island genes,
(ii) tcpC, which is present in some strains of Escherichia coli and (iii) gelE
presented in some strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Additionally, we screened for
the presence of the following genes encoding cyclomodulins that disrupted
mammalian cell division: (iv) cdt (which encodes the cytolethal distending toxin)
and (v) cnf-1 (which encodes the cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1). Our results
show that 20% of the samples (N = 41) tested positive for detectable amounts of
pks island genes, whereas 10% of individuals were positive for tcpC or gelE and
only one individual was found to harbor the cnf-1 gene. Of the 13 individuals
that were positive for at least one of the pro-inflammatory genes, 5 were found
to harbor more than one. A quantitative version of the assay, which used
real-time PCR, revealed the pro-inflammatory genes to be in high copy numbers: up
to 1.3 million copies per mg of feces for the pks island genes. Direct detection 
of specific genes in stool could prove useful toward screening for the presence
of pro-inflammatory bacterial genes in individuals with inflammatory bowel
diseases or colorectal cancer.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of protopanaxadiol (PPD), a gut
microbiome induced ginseng metabolite, in increasing the anticancer effects of a 
chemotherapeutic agent fluorouracil (5-FU) on colorectal cancer. An in vitro
HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell proliferation test was conducted to observe the
effects of PPD, 5-FU and their co-administration and the related mechanisms of
action. Then, an in vivo xenografted athymic mouse model was used to confirm the 
in vitro data. Our results showed that the human gut microbiome converted
ginsenoside compound K to PPD as a metabolite. PPD and 5-FU significantly
inhibited HCT-116 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner (both
p<0.01), and the effects of 5-FU were very significantly enhanced by combined
treatment with PPD (p<0.01). Cell cycle evaluation demonstrated that 5-FU
markedly induced the cancer cell S phase arrest, while PPD increased arrest in G1
phase. Compared to the control, 5-FU and PPD increased apoptosis, and their
co-administration significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells (p<0.01).
Using bioluminescence imaging, in vivo data revealed that 5-FU significantly
reduced the tumor growth up to Day 20 (p<0.05). PPD and 5-FU co-administration
very significantly reduced the tumor size in a dose-related manner (p<0.01
compared to the 5-FU alone). The quantification of the tumor size and weight
changes for 43 days supported the in vivo imaging data. Our results demonstrated 
that the co-administration of PPD and 5-FU significantly inhibited the tumor
growth, indicating that PPD significantly enhanced the anticancer action of 5-FU,
a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent. PPD may have a clinical value in 5-FU's
cancer therapeutics.

Prebiotics are ingredients selectively fermented by the intestinal microbiota
that promote changes in the microbial community structure and/or their
metabolism, conferring health benefits to the host. Studies show that β (1-4)
galacto-oligosaccharides [β (1-4) GOS], lactulose and fructo-oligosaccharides
increase intestinal concentration of lactate and short chain fatty acids, and
stool frequency and weight, and they decrease fecal concentration of secondary
bile acids, fecal pH, and nitroreductase and β-glucuronidase activities
suggesting a clear role in colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. This review
summarizes research on prebiotics bioassimilation, specifically β (1-4) GOS, and 
their potential role in CRC. We also evaluate research that show that the impact 
of prebiotics on host physiology can be direct or through modulation of the gut
intestinal microbiome, specifically the probiome (autochtonous beneficial
bacteria), we present studies on a potential role in CRC progression to finally
describe the current state of β (1-4) GOS generation for industrial production.

Understanding the complex pathophysiology of colorectal cancer and the
interaction between host genetics, the gut microbiome, and diet has attracted
significant attention in the last few years. The discovery that gut microbial
metabolites may dictate the course of colorectal cancer progression supports the 
development of microbial-targeted strategies.

Escherichia coli strains of phylogenetic group B2 and D and bacteriocin
production are associated with advanced colorectal neoplasia.

Kohoutova D, Smajs D, Moravkova P, Cyrany J, Moravkova M, Forstlova M, Cihak M,
Rejchrt S, Bures J.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common cancer worldwide and
the Czech Republic has the 6th highest incidence of CRC worldwide. Large
intestinal microbiota play in its etiopathogenesis important role. Bacteriocins
are proteins, produced by bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family. The aim of
our prospective study was to assess the colonization of large intestinal mucosa
by Escherichia coli strains and to investigate their bacteriocin production.
METHODS: A total of 30 consecutive patients with colorectal adenoma, CRA (17 men,
13 women, aged 39-79, mean age 63 ± 9), 30 patients with CRC (23 men, 7 women,
aged 38-86, mean age 67 ± 11) and 20 healthy controls (9 men, 11 women, age
23-84, mean age 55 ± 15) were enrolled into prospective study. Mucosal biopsies
were taken in the caecum, transverse colon and rectum during pancolonoscopy.
Microbiological culture, isolation and identification of bacteria followed.
Bacteriocin production was assessed by growth inhibition of indicator strains E. 
coli K12-Row, E. coli C6 (phi), and Shigella sonnei 17. Identification of
bacteriocin-encoding determinants and E. coli phylogroups was performed using PCR
methods.
RESULTS: A total of 622 strains were isolated and further investigated. A
significantly higher frequency of simultaneous production of colicins and
microcins was revealed in the group of patients with CRC, when compared to
patients with CRA, p = 0.031. A significantly higher frequency of E. coli
phylogroup D was found in patients with CRC, when compared to controls,
p = 0.044. A significantly higher prevalence of bacteriocinogeny was confirmed in
patients with advanced adenoma when compared to patients with non-advanced
adenoma, p = 0.010. Increasing bacteriocinogeny was associated with an increasing
stage of CRC (assessed according to TNM classification). Either E. coli
phylogroup B2 or E. coli phylogroup D were isolated in biopsies of patients with 
right-sided CRC. A statistically higher incidence of E. coli phylogroup B2 was
found in patients with right-sided CRC when compared to patients with left-sided 
CRC, p = 0.028.
CONCLUSIONS: Large intestinal mucosa of patients with more advanced colorectal
neoplasia is colonized with more virulent strains of E. coli and higher
production of bacteriocins is observed in these patients when compared to those
with less advanced colorectal neoplasia.

Bioactive compounds produced by gut microbial tannase: implications for
colorectal cancer development.

The microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract have a profound influence 
on the transformation of food into metabolites which can impact human health.
Gallic acid (GA) and pyrogallol (PG) are bioactive compounds displaying diverse
biological properties, including carcinogenic inhibiting activities. However, its
concentration in fruits and vegetables is generally low. These metabolites can be
also generated as final products of tannin metabolism by microbes endowed with
tannase, which opens up the possibility of their anti-cancer potential being
increased. Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) display an imbalanced gut
microbiota respect to healthy population. The recent use of next generation
sequencing technologies has greatly improved knowledge of the identity of
bacterial species that colonize non-tumorous and tumorous tissues of CRC
patients. This information provides a unique opportunity to shed light on the
role played by gut microorganisms in the different stages of this disease. We
here review the recently published gut microbiome associated to CRC patients and 
highlight tannase as an underlying gene function of bacterial species that
selectively colonize tumorous tissues, but not adjacent non-malignant tissues.
Given the anti-carcinogenic roles of GA and PG produced by gut tannin-degrading
bacteria, we provide an overview of the possible consequences of this intriguing 
coincidence for CRC development.

Antibiotic suppression of intestinal microbiota reduces heme-induced
lipoperoxidation associated with colon carcinogenesis in rats.

Epidemiological studies show that heme iron from red meat is associated with
increased colorectal cancer risk. In carcinogen-induced-rats, a heme iron-rich
diet increases the number of precancerous lesions and raises associated fecal
biomarkers. Heme-induced lipoperoxidation measured by fecal thiobarbituric acid
reagents (TBARs) could explain the promotion of colon carcinogenesis by heme.
Using a factorial design we studied if microbiota could be involved in
heme-induced carcinogenesis, by modulating peroxidation. Rats treated or not with
an antibiotic cocktail were given a control or a hemoglobin-diet. Fecal bacteria 
were counted on agar and TBARs concentration assayed in fecal water. The
suppression of microbiota by antibiotics was associated with a reduction of crypt
height and proliferation and with a cecum enlargement, which are characteristics 
of germ-free rats. Rats given hemoglobin diets had increased fecal TBARs, which
were suppressed by the antibiotic treatment. A duplicate experiment in rats given
dietary hemin yielded similar results. These data show that the intestinal
microbiota is involved in enhancement of lipoperoxidation by heme iron. We thus
suggest that microbiota could play a role in the heme-induced promotion of
colorectal carcinogenesis.

Wheat bran extract (WBE), containing arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides that are
potential prebiotic substrates, has been shown to modify bacterial colonic
fermentation in human subjects and to beneficially affect the development of
colorectal cancer (CRC) in rats. However, it is unclear whether these changes in 
fermentation are able to reduce the risk of developing CRC in humans. The aim of 
the present study was to evaluate the effects of WBE on the markers of CRC risk
in healthy volunteers, and to correlate these effects with colonic fermentation. 
A total of twenty healthy subjects were enrolled in a double-blind, cross-over,
randomised, controlled trial in which the subjects ingested WBE (10 g/d) or
placebo (maltodextrin, 10 g/d) for 3 weeks, separated by a 3-week washout period.
At the end of each study period, colonic handling of NH3 was evaluated using the 
biomarker lactose[15N, 15N']ureide, colonic fermentation was characterised
through a metabolomics approach, and the predominant microbial composition was
analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. As markers of CRC risk,
faecal water genotoxicity was determined using the comet assay and faecal water
cytotoxicity using a colorimetric cell viability assay. Intake of WBE induced a
shift from urinary to faecal 15N excretion, indicating a stimulation of colonic
bacterial activity and/or growth. Microbial analysis revealed a selective
stimulation of Bifidobacterium adolescentis. In addition, WBE altered the colonic
fermentation pattern and significantly reduced colonic protein fermentation
compared with the run-in period. However, faecal water cytotoxicity and
genotoxicity were not affected. Although intake of WBE clearly affected colonic
fermentation and changed the composition of the microbiota, these changes were
not associated with the changes in the markers of CRC risk.

Environmental factors clearly affect colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence, but the
mechanisms through which these factors function are unknown. One prime candidate 
is an altered colonic microbiota. Here we show that the mucosal microbiota
organization is a critical factor associated with a subset of CRC. We identified 
invasive polymicrobial bacterial biofilms (bacterial aggregates), structures
previously associated with nonmalignant intestinal pathology, nearly universally 
(89%) on right-sided tumors (13 of 15 CRCs, 4 of 4 adenomas) but on only 12% of
left-sided tumors (2 of 15 CRCs, 0 of 2 adenomas). Surprisingly, patients with
biofilm-positive tumors, whether cancers or adenomas, all had biofilms on their
tumor-free mucosa far distant from their tumors. Bacterial biofilms were
associated with diminished colonic epithelial cell E-cadherin and enhanced
epithelial cell IL-6 and Stat3 activation, as well as increased crypt epithelial 
cell proliferation in normal colon mucosa. High-throughput sequencing revealed no
consistent bacterial genus associated with tumors, regardless of biofilm status. 
However, principal coordinates analysis revealed that biofilm communities on
paired normal mucosa, distant from the tumor itself, cluster with tumor
microbiomes as opposed to biofilm-negative normal mucosa bacterial communities
also from the tumor host. Colon mucosal biofilm detection may predict increased
risk for development of sporadic CRC.

The gut microbiota is suspected to promote colorectal cancer (CRC). Escherichia
coli are more frequently found in CCR biopsies than in healthy mucosa;
furthermore, the majority of mucosa-associated E. coli isolated from CCR harbors 
the pks genomic island (pks+ E. coli) that is responsible for the synthesis of
colibactin, a genotoxic compound. We have recently reported that transient
contact of a few malignant cells with colibactin-producing E. coli increases
tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Growth is sustained by cellular
senescence that is accompanied by the production of growth factors. We
demonstrated that cellular senescence is a consequence of the pks+ E.
coli-induced alteration of p53 SUMOylation, an essential post-translational
modification in eukaryotic cells. The underlying mechanisms for this process
involve the induction of miR-20a-5p expression, which targets SENP1, a key
protein in the regulation of the SUMOylation process. These results are
consistent with the expression of SENP1, miR-20a-5p and growth factors that are
observed in a CRC mouse model and in human CCR biopsies colonized by pks+ E.
coli. Overall, the data reveal a new paradigm for carcinogenesis in which pks+ E.
coli infection induces cellular senescence characterized by the production of
growth factors that promote the proliferation of uninfected cells and,
subsequently, tumor growth.

Natural products play an important role in cancer therapeutics, and lately more
attentions have been paid to the prevention of major lethal malignancies, such as
colorectal cancer (CRC). After oral ingestion, botanicals' parent compounds can
be converted to their metabolites by the enteric microbiome, and these
metabolites may have different bioactivities and variable bioavailability. In
this study, we used an active ginseng metabolite, protopanaxadiol (PPD), as an
example to assess its colon cancer preventive effect by comparing its effect with
the treatment effect of fluorouracil (5-FU). A xenograft tumor nude mouse model
with human colon cancer cell inoculation was used. After preventive PPD or
treatment 5-FU administration with the same dose (30 mg/kg), tumor growth
inhibition was evaluated by both a Xenogen bioluminescence imaging technique and 
manual tumor size measurement. Our data showed that preventive PPD very
significantly inhibited the tumor growth compared to 5-FU (p < 0.01). Our data
suggest that the PPD is a promising cancer prevention agent. More studies are
needed to explore the chemopreventive actions of PPD and its potential clinical
utility.

Dietary composition has an important role in shaping the gut microbiota. In turn,
changes in the diet directly impinge on bacterial metabolites present in the
intestinal lumen. Whether such metabolites play a role in intestinal cancer has
been a topic of hot debate. In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Donohoe and
colleagues show that dietary fiber protects against colorectal carcinoma in a
microbiota-dependent manner. Furthermore, fiber-derived butyrate acts as a
histone deacetylase inhibitor, inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing
apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells experiencing the Warburg effect.

The human body normally lives in symbiosis with a considerable microscopic
environment present on all interfaces with the external environment; it hosts ten
times more microbes (microbiota) that it has somatic or germ cells, representing 
a gene diversity (microbiome) 100-150 times higher than the human genome. These
germs are located mainly in the gut, where they represent a mass of about one
kilogram. The primary colonization of the gastrointestinal tract depends on the
delivery route, the bacterial flora rewarding then depending on the environment, 
food hygiene, medical treatments. The intestinal microbiota plays an important
role in the maturation of the immune system and in different physiological
functions: digestion of polysaccharides, glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins,
vitamins biosynthesis, bile salt metabolism of some amino acids and xenobiotics. 
Quantitative and qualitative changes in the microbiota are observed in a wide
range of diseases: obesity, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, inflammatory bowel
disease, autoimmune diseases, allergies... pharmacobiotics aim to modify the
intestinal microbiota in a therapeutic goal and this by various means:
prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics or fecal transplants. Intestinal flora also
plays a direct role in the metabolism of certain drugs and the microbiota should 
be considered as a predictive parameter of response to some chemotherapies.

Several bacterial species have been implicated in the development of colorectal
carcinoma (CRC), but CRC-associated changes of fecal microbiota and their
potential for cancer screening remain to be explored. Here, we used metagenomic
sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC 
patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants.
Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult
blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved > 
45% relative to the FOBT, while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of
metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early- and
late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control
populations (N = 335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the
fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at 
the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal
tumor-related host-microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift
from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino
acids in CRC patients, accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide
metabolism.

Few studies have examined associations between plasma choline metabolites and
risk of colorectal cancer. Therefore, we investigated associations between plasma
biomarkers of choline metabolism [choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, and
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] and colorectal cancer risk among postmenopausal
women in a case-control study nested within the Women's Health Initiative
Observational Study. We selected 835 matched case-control pairs, and cases were
further stratified by tumor site (proximal, distal, or rectal) and stage
(local/regional or metastatic). Colorectal cancer was assessed by self-report and
confirmed by medical records over the mean of 5.2 years of follow-up. Baseline
plasma choline metabolites were measured by LC/MS-MS. In multivariable-adjusted
conditional logistic regression models, plasma choline tended to be positively
associated with rectal cancer risk [OR (95% confidence interval, CI)(highest vs. 
lowest quartile) = 2.44 (0.93-6.40); P trend = 0.08], whereas plasma betaine was 
inversely associated with colorectal cancer overall [0.68 (0.47-0.99); P trend = 
0.01] and with local/regional tumors [0.64 (0.42-0.99); P trend = 0.009].
Notably, the plasma betaine:choline ratio was inversely associated with
colorectal cancer overall [0.56 (0.39-0.82); P trend = 0.004] as well as with
proximal [0.66 (0.41-1.06); P trend = 0.049], rectal [0.27 (0.10-0.78); P trend =
0.02], and local/regional [0.50 (0.33-0.76); P trend = 0.001] tumors. Finally,
plasma TMAO, an oxidative derivative of choline produced by intestinal bacteria, 
was positively associated with rectal cancer [3.38 (1.25-9.16); P trend = 0.02]
and with overall colorectal cancer risk among women with lower (vs. higher)
plasma vitamin B12 levels (P interaction = 0.003). Collectively, these data
suggest that alterations in choline metabolism, which may arise early in disease 
development, may be associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer. The
positive association between plasma TMAO and colorectal cancer risk is consistent
with an involvement of the gut microbiome in colorectal cancer pathogenesis.

Folate is absorbed across the human colon: evidence by using enteric-coated
caplets containing 13C-labeled [6S]-5-formyltetrahydrofolate.

DLO); CDC, Atlanta, GA (ZF and CMP); and the Food Science and Human Nutrition
Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL (JFG).

BACKGROUND: Folate intakes that do not meet or greatly exceed requirements may be
associated with negative health outcomes. A better understanding of contributors 
that influence the input side will help establish dietary guidance that ensures
health benefits without associated risks. Colonic microbiota produce large
quantities of folate, and [(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate infused during
colonoscopy is absorbed. However, it is unclear if significant quantities of
folate are absorbed in an intact microbiome.
OBJECTIVE: We determined whether and how much of a physiologic dose of
[(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate delivered in a pH-sensitive enteric caplet to an
intact colonic microbiome is absorbed.
DESIGN: Healthy adults ingested a specially designed pH-sensitive acrylic
copolymer-coated barium sulfate caplet that contained 855 nmol (400 μg)
[(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate. After a washout period ≥ 4 wk, subjects
received an intravenous injection of the same compound (214 nmol). Serially
collected blood samples before and after each test dose were analyzed by using a 
microbiological assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Caplet disintegration in the colon was observed by fluoroscopic imaging 
for 6 subjects with a mean (± SD) complete disintegration time of 284 ± 155 min. 
The mean (± SEM) rate of appearance of [(13)C5]5-methyltetrahydrofolate in plasma
was 0.33 ± 0.09 (caplet) and 5.8 ± 1.2 (intravenous) nmol/h. Likely because of
the significant time in the colon, the mean apparent absorption across the colon 
was 46%.
CONCLUSIONS: Folate is absorbed across the colon in humans with an undisturbed
microbiome. This finding and previous observations of the size of the colonic
depot of folate and its potential for manipulation by diet (eg, dietary fiber,
oligosaccharides, and probiotics) suggest that an individual's dietary folate
requirement may differ depending on the consumption of dietary constituents that 
affect the size and composition of their gastrointestinal microbiota. In
addition, a systematic investigation of the role of colonic folate on
gastrointestinal development and the prevention of colorectal cancer is
warranted. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00941174.

BACKGROUND: Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) produces the Bacteroides 
fragilis toxin, which has been associated with acute diarrheal disease,
inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer (CRC). ETBF induces colon
carcinogenesis in experimental models. Previous human studies have demonstrated
frequent asymptomatic fecal colonization with ETBF, but no study has investigated
mucosal colonization that is expected to impact colon carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We compared the presence of the bft gene in mucosal samples from
colorectal neoplasia patients (cases, n = 49) to a control group undergoing
outpatient colonoscopy for CRC screening or diagnostic workup (controls, n = 49).
Single bacterial colonies isolated anaerobically from mucosal colon tissue were
tested for the bft gene with touch-down polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: The mucosa of cases was significantly more often bft-positive on left
(85.7%) and right (91.7%) tumor and/or paired normal tissues compared with left
and right control biopsies (53.1%; P = .033 and 55.5%; P = .04, respectively).
Detection of bft was concordant in most paired mucosal samples from individual
cases or controls (75% cases; 67% controls). There was a trend toward increased
bft positivity in mucosa from late- vs early-stage CRC patients (100% vs 72.7%,
respectively; P = .093). In contrast to ETBF diarrheal disease where bft-1
detection dominates, bft-2 was the most frequent toxin isotype identified in both
cases and controls, whereas multiple bft isotypes were detected more frequently
in cases (P ≤ .02).
CONCLUSIONS: The bft gene is associated with colorectal neoplasia, especially in 
late-stage CRC. Our results suggest that mucosal bft exposure is common and may
be a risk factor for developing CRC.

BACKGROUND: Tongue diagnosis, as a unique method of traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM), discriminates physiological functions and pathological conditions by
observing the changes of the tongue coating.
AIMS: To evaluate the differences of tongue images and tongue coating microbiome 
between patients with colorectal cancer and healthy people.
METHODS: The tongue diagnostic information acquisition system was used to
photograph the tongue images and analyze the thickness of the tongue coatings in 
patients with colorectal cancer and healthy people. The next-generation
sequencing technology was used to determine the V2-V4 hypervariable region of 16S
rDNA to investigate the microbial community structure and diversity on the tongue
coating.
RESULTS: The tongue coatings in patients with colorectal cancer were obvious
thickening compared with tongue images in healthy people. The microbial community
structure on the tongue coating was different between patients with colorectal
cancer and healthy people.
CONCLUSION: Tongue diagnosis may provide important leads towards novel
microbiome-related diagnostic tools and tongue coating microbiome may be a novel 
biomarker for characterizing patient with colorectal cancer.

Whether dietary fiber protects against colorectal cancer is controversial because
of conflicting results from human epidemiologic studies. However, these studies
and mouse models of colorectal cancer have not controlled the composition of gut 
microbiota, which ferment fiber into short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate.
Butyrate is noteworthy because it has energetic and epigenetic functions in
colonocytes and tumor-suppressive properties in colorectal cancer cell lines. We 
used gnotobiotic mouse models colonized with wild-type or mutant strains of a
butyrate-producing bacterium to demonstrate that fiber does have a potent
tumor-suppressive effect but in a microbiota- and butyrate-dependent manner.
Furthermore, due to the Warburg effect, butyrate was metabolized less in tumors
where it accumulated and functioned as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor to 
stimulate histone acetylation and affect apoptosis and cell proliferation. To
support the relevance of this mechanism in human cancer, we demonstrate that
butyrate and histone-acetylation levels are elevated in colorectal
adenocarcinomas compared with normal colonic tissues.SIGNIFICANCE: These results,
which link diet and microbiota to a tumor-suppressive metabolite, provide insight
into conflicting epidemiologic findings and suggest that probiotic/prebiotic
strategies can modulate an endogenous HDAC inhibitor for anticancer
chemoprevention without the adverse effects associated with synthetic HDAC
inhibitors used in chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing appreciation for sexually dimorphic effects, but 
the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are only partially understood. 
In the present study, we explored transcriptomics and epigenetic differences in
the small intestine and colon of prepubescent male and female mice. In addition, 
the microbiota composition of the colonic luminal content has been examined.
METHODS: At postnatal day 14, male and female C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed and
the small intestine, colon and content of luminal colon were isolated. Gene
expression of both segments of the intestine was analysed by microarray analysis.
DNA methylation of the promoter regions of selected sexually dimorphic genes was 
examined by pyrosequencing. Composition of the microbiota was explored by deep
sequencing.
RESULTS: Sexually dimorphic genes were observed in both segments of the intestine
of 2-week-old mouse pups, with a stronger effect in the small intestine. Amongst 
the total of 349 genes displaying a sexually dimorphic effect in the small
intestine and/or colon, several candidates exhibited a previously established
function in the intestine (i.e. Nts, Nucb2, Alox5ap and Retnlγ). In addition,
differential expression of genes linked to intestinal bowel disease (i.e. Ccr3,
Ccl11 and Tnfr) and colorectal cancer development (i.e. Wt1 and Mmp25) was
observed between males and females. Amongst the genes displaying significant
sexually dimorphic expression, nine genes were histone-modifying enzymes,
suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms might be a potential underlying regulatory 
mechanism. However, our results reveal no significant changes in DNA methylation 
of analysed CpGs within the selected differentially expressed genes. With respect
to the bacterial community composition in the colon, a dominant effect of litter 
origin was found but no significant sex effect was detected. However, a sex
effect on the dominance of specific taxa was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals molecular dissimilarities between males and
females in the small intestine and colon of prepubescent mice, which might
underlie differences in physiological functioning and in disease predisposition
in the two sexes.

The emergence of a link between Helicobacter pylori infection and an increased
risk of gastric cancer has raised an awareness of a possible link between colonic
microbiota and colorectal cancer. Pertubation of the colonic epithelium by
toxin-producing strains of Bacteroides fragilis may increase the risk of
premalignant transdifferentiation. However, like H. pylori, B. fragilis exhibit
an ability to modulate the normal host response to infection. We speculate this
may be an underappreciated risk factor in the genesis of colon carcinogenesis in 
individuals colonised with toxin-producing strains of B. fragilis.

Enterobacteria, especially Escherichia coli, are abundant in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear
whether cancer is promoted by inflammation-induced expansion of E. coli and/or
changes in expression of specific microbial genes. Here we use longitudinal (2,
12 and 20 weeks) 16S rRNA sequencing of luminal microbiota from ex-germ-free mice
to show that inflamed Il10(-/-) mice maintain a higher abundance of
Enterobacteriaceae than healthy wild-type mice. Experiments with mono-colonized
Il10(-/-) mice reveal that host inflammation is necessary for E. coli
cancer-promoting activity. RNA-sequence analysis indicates significant changes in
E. coli gene catalogue in Il10(-/-) mice, with changes mostly driven by
adaptation to the intestinal environment. Expression of specific genes present in
the tumour-promoting E. coli pks island are modulated by inflammation/CRC
development. Thus, progression of inflammation in Il10(-/-) mice supports
Enterobacteriaceae and alters a small subset of microbial genes important for
tumour development.

Arabinoxylans (AX) consumption has been related to the treatment and prevention
of cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, colorectal cancer and obesity. The 
beneficial health effects are conferred through gut microbiota modulation, and
therefore, they have been proposed as potential slowly fermentable prebiotic
candidates. As the mechanisms are not yet well understood, the prebiotic
potential of AX from brewer's spent grain (BSG) has been investigated. Two types 
of AX from BSG (AX1 and AX2) of different length and branching averages were
fermented with human faecal inocula and compared to fermented cultures containing
a commercial prebiotic (fructooligosaccharide (FOS)) and cultures with no added
carbohydrate (control). Results demonstrated that the AX were extensively
metabolised after 48 h of fermentation. The pH decreased along fermentation and
the lowest value was achieved in AX1 cultures. The production of short chain
fatty acids (SCFA) was higher in AX cultures than in cultures containing FOS and 
controls, with AX1 presenting the highest concentrations. The stimulatory effect 
of beneficial bacteria was higher in AX cultures, and AX2 presented the highest
positive effect. Prebiotic potential of AX from BSG was confirmed by the
production of SCFA and the modulation of gut microbiota, especially by the high
increase in bifidobacteria populations.

Recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiome may be an important factor 
in the development of colorectal cancer. Abnormalities in the gut microbiome have
been reported in patients with colorectal cancer; however, this microbial
community has not been explored as a potential screen for early-stage disease. We
characterized the gut microbiome in patients from three clinical groups
representing the stages of colorectal cancer development: healthy, adenoma, and
carcinoma. Analysis of the gut microbiome from stool samples revealed both an
enrichment and depletion of several bacterial populations associated with
adenomas and carcinomas. Combined with known clinical risk factors of colorectal 
cancer (e.g., BMI, age, race), data from the gut microbiome significantly
improved the ability to differentiate between healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma
clinical groups relative to risk factors alone. Using Bayesian methods, we
determined that using gut microbiome data as a screening tool improved the
pretest to posttest probability of adenoma more than 50-fold. For example, the
pretest probability in a 65-year-old was 0.17% and, after using the microbiome
data, this increased to 10.67% (1 in 9 chance of having an adenoma). Taken
together, the results of our study demonstrate the feasibility of using the
composition of the gut microbiome to detect the presence of precancerous and
cancerous lesions. Furthermore, these results support the need for more
cross-sectional studies with diverse populations and linkage to other stool
markers, dietary data, and personal health information.

High red meat consumption is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer.
Various mechanisms have been proposed, including mutagenesis, alterations of the 
gut microbiome, and effects on local immunity and inflammation. This lack of
well-defined mechanistic explanations for diet and cancer associations coupled
with our inability to derive causal inferences from population-based studies
allows us to rationalize that burger we ate at lunch or that steak we ate at
dinner. The preparation and consumption of red meat is a major social and dining 
pleasure in the Western culture, so there is resistance to concern ourselves with
the cancer risk associated with red meat. In fact, advertisements do not add a
rapid-fire statement that consumption of more than half a portion of red meat per
day has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
cancer, and even death, because these data are not from randomized controlled
trials? Would we heed a warning if there was evidence that burgers and steaks
induced the expression of small noncoding RNAs that inhibit the expression of
tumor-suppressor genes in our enterocytes? What level of evidence is necessary to
convince ourselves that a dietary exposure is sufficiently causal to put a
warning label on it? How do we experimentally obtain such evidence? If we knew
the mechanism, perhaps we could modify the risk sufficiently such that we can
have our steak and eat it too-without the warnings.

The etiology of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been linked to deficiencies in
mismatch repair and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) proteins, diet, inflammatory
processes, and gut microbiota. However, the mechanism through which the
microbiota synergizes with these etiologic factors to promote CRC is not clear.
We report that altering the microbiota composition reduces CRC in
APC(Min/+)MSH2(-/-) mice, and that a diet reduced in carbohydrates phenocopies
this effect. Gut microbes did not induce CRC in these mice through an
inflammatory response or the production of DNA mutagens but rather by providing
carbohydrate-derived metabolites such as butyrate that fuel hyperproliferation of
MSH2(-/-) colon epithelial cells. Further, we provide evidence that the mismatch 
repair pathway has a role in regulating β-catenin activity and modulating the
differentiation of transit-amplifying cells in the colon. These data thereby
provide an explanation for the interaction between microbiota, diet, and mismatch
repair deficiency in CRC induction. PAPERCLIP:

BACKGROUND: The clinical benefit of guaiac fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) is now
well established for colorectal cancer screening. Growing evidence has
demonstrated that epigenetic modifications and fecal microbiota changes, also
known as dysbiosis, are associated with CRC pathogenesis and might be used as
surrogate markers of CRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study that included all
consecutive subjects that were referred (from 2003 to 2007) for screening
colonoscopies. Prior to colonoscopy, effluents (fresh stools, sera-S and urine-U)
were harvested and FOBTs performed. Methylation levels were measured in stools, S
and U for 3 genes (Wif1, ALX-4, and Vimentin) selected from a panel of 63 genes; 
Kras mutations and seven dominant and subdominant bacterial populations in stools
were quantified. Calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square,
and discrimination was determined by calculating the C-statistic (Area Under
Curve) and Net Reclassification Improvement index.
RESULTS: There were 247 individuals (mean age 60.8±12.4 years, 52% of males) in
the study group, and 90 (36%) of these individuals were patients with advanced
polyps or invasive adenocarcinomas. A multivariate model adjusted for age and
FOBT led to a C-statistic of 0.83 [0.77-0.88]. After supplementary sequential
(one-by-one) adjustment, Wif-1 methylation (S or U) and fecal microbiota
dysbiosis led to increases of the C-statistic to 0.90 [0.84-0.94] (p = 0.02) and 
0.81 [0.74-0.86] (p = 0.49), respectively. When adjusted jointly for FOBT and
Wif-1 methylation or fecal microbiota dysbiosis, the increase of the C-statistic 
was even more significant (0.91 and 0.85, p<0.001 and p = 0.10, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The detection of methylated Wif-1 in either S or U has a higher
performance accuracy compared to guaiac FOBT for advanced colorectal neoplasia
screening. Conversely, fecal microbiota dysbiosis detection was not more
accurate. Blood and urine testing could be used in those individuals reluctant to
undergo stool testing.

Dysfunction of Paneth and goblet cells in the intestine contributes to
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). 
Here, we report a role for the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 in the
control of anti-bacterial defense. Mice with an intestinal specific Sirt1
deficiency (Sirt1int-/-) have more Paneth and goblet cells with a consequent
rearrangement of the gut microbiota. From a mechanistic point of view, the
effects on mouse intestinal cell maturation are mediated by SIRT1-dependent
changes in the acetylation status of SPDEF, a master regulator of Paneth and
goblet cells. Our results suggest that targeting SIRT1 may be of interest in the 
management of IBD and CAC.

BACKGROUND: Both genetic and epigenetic alterations have been reported to act as 
driving forces of tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC), but a growing body of
evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota may be an aetiological factor in the
initiation and progression of CRC. Recently, the "driver-passenger" model for CRC
has connected these different factors, but little has been done to characterize
the CRC gut microbiome.
FINDINGS: Building on the driver-passenger model, we used 454 pyrosequencing of
bacterial 16S rRNA genes associated with 10 normal, 10 adenoma, and 8 tumor
biopsy samples, and found 7 potential driver bacterial genera and 12 potential
passenger bacterial genera (7 being pro-inflammatory and 5 anti-inflammatory).
Further analysis also showed certain co-expression patterns among different
clusters of bacteria that may potentially be related to the promotion or
progression of gut cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide preliminary experimental evidence
supporting the proposition of bacterial "driver-passenger model" for CRC, and
identified potentially novel microbial agents that may be connected to risk of
CRC in a Han Chinese population.

Ellagic acid metabolism by human gut microbiota: consistent observation of three 
urolithin phenotypes in intervention trials, independent of food source, age, and
health status.

P.O. Box 164, 30100 Espinardo, Murcia, Spain.

Three phenotypes for urolithin production after ellagitannin and ellagic acid
intake are consistently observed in different human intervention trials. Subjects
can be stratified into three urolithin-producing groups. "Phenotype A" produced
only urolithin A conjugates, which included between 25 and 80% of the volunteers 
in the different trials. "Phenotype B" produced isourolithin A and/or urolithin B
in addition to urolithin A, this being the second relevant group (10-50%).
"Phenotype 0" (5-25%) was that in which these urolithins were not detected. The
three phenotypes were observed independently of the volunteers' health status and
demographic characteristics (age, gender, body mass index (BMI)) and of the
amount or type of ellagitannin food source ingested (walnuts and other nuts,
strawberries, raspberries, and other berries or pomegranates). Interestingly, a
higher percentage of phenotype B was observed in those volunteers with chronic
illness (metabolic syndrome or colorectal cancer) associated with gut microbial
imbalance (dysbiosis). These urolithin phenotypes could show differences in the
human gut microbiota and should be considered in intervention trials dealing with
health benefits of ellagitannins or ellagic acid. Whether this phenotypic
variation could be a biomarker related to differential health benefits or illness
predisposition deserves further research.

Structure of the gut microbiome following colonization with human feces
determines colonic tumor burden.

BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence indicates that the gut microbiome plays a 
role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients with CRC harbor gut 
microbiomes that are structurally distinct from those of healthy individuals;
however, without the ability to track individuals during disease progression, it 
has not been possible to observe changes in the microbiome over the course of
tumorigenesis. Mouse models have demonstrated that these changes can further
promote colonic tumorigenesis. However, these models have relied upon
mouse-adapted bacterial populations and so it remains unclear which human-adapted
bacterial populations are responsible for modulating tumorigenesis.
RESULTS: We transplanted fecal microbiota from three CRC patients and three
healthy individuals into germ-free mice, resulting in six structurally distinct
microbial communities. Subjecting these mice to a chemically induced model of CRC
resulted in different levels of tumorigenesis between mice. Differences in the
number of tumors were strongly associated with the baseline microbiome structure 
in mice, but not with the cancer status of the human donors. Partitioning of
baseline communities into enterotypes by Dirichlet multinomial mixture modeling
resulted in three enterotypes that corresponded with tumor burden. The taxa most 
strongly positively correlated with increased tumor burden were members of the
Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Alistipes, and Akkermansia, all of which are
Gram-negative. Members of the Gram-positive Clostridiales, including multiple
members of Clostridium Group XIVa, were strongly negatively correlated with
tumors. Analysis of the inferred metagenome of each community revealed a negative
correlation between tumor count and the potential for butyrate production, and a 
positive correlation between tumor count and the capacity for host glycan
degradation. Despite harboring distinct gut communities, all mice underwent
conserved structural changes over the course of the model. The extent of these
changes was also correlated with tumor incidence.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the initial structure of the microbiome
determines susceptibility to colonic tumorigenesis. There appear to be opposing
roles for certain Gram-negative (Bacteroidales and Verrucomicrobia) and
Gram-positive (Clostridiales) bacteria in tumor susceptibility. Thus, the impact 
of community structure is potentially mediated by the balance between protective,
butyrate-producing populations and inflammatory, mucin-degrading populations.

OBJECTIVE: Commensal bacteria and innate immunity play a major role in the
development of colorectal cancer (CRC). We propose that selected commensals
polarise colon macrophages to produce endogenous mutagens that initiate
chromosomal instability (CIN), lead to expression of progenitor and tumour stem
cell markers, and drive CRC through a bystander effect.
DESIGN: Primary murine colon epithelial cells were repetitively exposed to
Enterococcus faecalis-infected macrophages, or purified trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
(4-HNE)-an endogenous mutagen and spindle poison produced by macrophages. CIN,
gene expression, growth as allografts in immunodeficient mice were examined for
clones and expression of markers confirmed using interleukin (IL) 10 knockout
mice colonised by E. faecalis.
RESULTS: Primary colon epithelial cells exposed to polarised macrophages or
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal developed CIN and were transformed after 10 weekly
treatments. In immunodeficient mice, 8 of 25 transformed clones grew as poorly
differentiated carcinomas with 3 tumours invading skin and/or muscle. All tumours
stained for cytokeratins confirming their epithelial cell origin. Gene expression
profiling of clones showed alterations in 3 to 7 cancer driver genes per clone.
Clones also strongly expressed stem/progenitor cell markers Ly6A and Ly6E.
Although not differentially expressed in clones, murine allografts positively
stained for the tumour stem cell marker doublecortin-like kinase 1.
Doublecortin-like kinase 1 and Ly6A/E were expressed by epithelial cells in colon
biopsies for areas of inflamed and dysplastic tissue from E. faecalis-colonised
IL-10 knockout mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These results validate a novel mechanism for CRC that involves
endogenous CIN and cellular transformation arising through a microbiome-driven
bystander effect.

BACKGROUND: There is clear evidence that nutrition and lifestyle can modify
colorectal cancer risk. However, it is not clear if those factors can affect
colorectal cancer treatment, recurrence, survival and quality of life. This paper
describes the background and design of the "COlorectal cancer: Longitudinal,
Observational study on Nutritional and lifestyle factors that may influence
colorectal tumour recurrence, survival and quality of life" - COLON - study. The 
main aim of this study is to assess associations of diet and other lifestyle
factors, with colorectal cancer recurrence, survival and quality of life. We
extensively investigate diet and lifestyle of colorectal cancer patients at
diagnosis and during the following years; this design paper focusses on the
initial exposures of interest: diet and dietary supplement use, body composition,
nutrient status (e.g. vitamin D), and composition of the gut microbiota.
METHODS/DESIGN: The COLON study is a multi-centre prospective cohort study among 
at least 1,000 incident colorectal cancer patients recruited from 11 hospitals in
the Netherlands. Patients with colorectal cancer are invited upon diagnosis. Upon
recruitment, after 6 months, 2 years and 5 years, patients fill out
food-frequency questionnaires; questionnaires about dietary supplement use,
physical activity, weight, height, and quality of life; and donate blood samples.
Diagnostic CT-scans are collected to assess cross-sectional areas of skeletal
muscle, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and intermuscular fat, and to assess
muscle attenuation. Blood samples are biobanked to facilitate future analyse of
biomarkers, nutrients, DNA etc. Analysis of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels,
and analysis of metabolomic profiles are scheduled. A subgroup of patients with
colon cancer is asked to provide faecal samples before and at several time points
after colon resection to study changes in gut microbiota during treatment. For
all patients, information on vital status is retrieved by linkage with national
registries. Information on clinical characteristics is gathered from linkage with
the Netherlands Cancer Registry and with hospital databases. Hazards ratios will 
be calculated for dietary and lifestyle factors at diagnosis in relation to
recurrence and survival. Repeated measures analyses will be performed to assess
changes over time in dietary and other factors in relation to recurrence and
survival.

Bacterial colonisation of the gut is involved in the development of
colitis-associated colorectal cancer. However, it remains unclear how the gut
microbiota dynamically shifts correlating with colorectal carcinogenesis. Here,
we reveal the longitudinal shifts in the microbial community that occur with
colitis-associated colorectal cancer. High-throughput sequencing results for the 
bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V3 region) were compared for azoxymethane/dextran sodium
sulphate-treated mice and control mice. We found that microbial community
structure was significantly altered by chronic colitis. Microbes in the species
Streptococcus luteciae, Lactobacillus hamster, Bacteroides uniformis and
Bacteroides ovatus were increased during colorectal carcinogenesis. Histological 
measurements for a molecular network including six interconnected key factors
from inflammation to cancer, namely p65, p53, COX-2, PPARγ, CCR2 and β-catenin,
indicated that the microbiome modifications were correlated with molecular
pathogenesis of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Phylotype modifications
after each AOM/DSS cycle were identified. A longitudinal microbial network was
then constructed for the gut microbiome and showed that the phylotype shifts
during this process were complex and highly dynamic. This work may provide a
deeper understanding of the role of the microbiota and microbe-host interactions 
in colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies demonstrate a link between gastrointestinal
cancers and environmental factors such as diet. It has been suggested that
environmental cancer risk is determined by the interaction between diet and
microbes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that
microbiota composition during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression might differ
depending on the stage of the disease.
METHODS: A total of 28 age-matched and sex-matched subjects, seven with CRC
adenocarcinoma, 11 with tubular adenomas and ten healthy subjects with intact
colon, were included into the study. Microbiomes from mucosal and fecal samples
were analyzed with 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing, together with
quantitative PCR of specific bacteria and archaea.
RESULTS: The principal coordinates analysis clearly separated healthy tissue
samples from polyps and tumors, supporting the presence of specific bacterial
consortia that are associated with affected sites and that can serve as potential
biomarkers of CRC progression. A higher presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and
Enterobacteriaceae was found by qPCR in samples from CRC compared to healthy
controls. We observed a correlation between CRC process development and levels of
Methanobacteriales (R = 0.537, P = 0.007) and Methanobrevibacterium (R = 0.574, P
= 0.03) in fecal samples.
CONCLUSION: Differences in microbial and archaeal composition between mucosal
samples from healthy and disease tissues were observed in tubular adenoma and
adenocarcinoma. In addition, microbiota from mucosal samples represented the
underlying dysbiosis, whereas fecal samples seem not to be appropriate to detect 
shifts in microbial composition. CRC risk is influenced by microbial composition,
showing differences according to disease progression step and tumor severity.

In humans, the intestine is the major reservoir of microbes. Although the
intestinal microbial community exists in a state of homeostasis called eubiosis, 
environmental and genetics factors can lead to microbial perturbation or
dysbiosis, a state associated with various pathologies including inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Dysbiotic microbiota is thought
to contribute to the initiation and progression of CRC. At the opposite end of
the spectrum, two recently published studies in Science reveal that the
microbiota is essential for chemotherapeutic drug efficacy, suggesting a
beneficial microbial function in cancer management. The dichotomy between the
beneficial and detrimental roles of the microbiota during cancer initiation,
progression, and treatment emphasize the interwoven relationship between bacteria
and cancer. Moreover, these findings suggest that the microbiota could be
considered as a therapeutic target, not only at the level of cancer prevention,
but also during management, i.e. by enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutics.

Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with increased risk of developing
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Epidemiological data show that the
consumption of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) decreases the risk of 
sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). Importantly, recent data have shown that
eicosapentaenoic acid-free fatty acid (EPA-FFA) reduces polyp formation and
growth in models of familial adenomatous polyposis. However, the effects of
dietary EPA-FFA are unknown in CAC. We tested the effectiveness of substituting
EPA-FFA, for other dietary fats, in preventing inflammation and cancer in the
AOM-DSS model of CAC. The AOM-DSS protocols were designed to evaluate the effect 
of EPA-FFA on both initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis. We found that
EPA-FFA diet strongly decreased tumor multiplicity, incidence and maximum tumor
size in the promotion and initiation arms. Moreover EPA-FFA, in particular in the
initiation arm, led to reduced cell proliferation and nuclear β-catenin
expression, whilst it increased apoptosis. In both arms, EPA-FFA treatment led to
increased membrane switch from ω-6 to ω-3 PUFAs and a concomitant reduction in
PGE2 production. We observed no significant changes in intestinal inflammation
between EPA-FFA treated arms and AOM-DSS controls. Importantly, we found that
EPA-FFA treatment restored the loss of Notch signaling found in the AOM-DSS
control and resulted in the enrichment of Lactobacillus species in the gut
microbiota. Taken together, our data suggest that EPA-FFA is an excellent
candidate for CRC chemoprevention in CAC.

Recent reports have suggested that multiple factors such as host genetics,
environment and diet can promote the progression of healthy mucosa towards
sporadic colorectal carcinoma. Accumulating evidence has additionally associated 
intestinal bacteria with disease initiation and progression. In order to examine 
and analyze the composition of gut microbiota in the absence of confounding
influences, we have established an animal model of 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine
(DMH)-induced colon cancer. Using this model, we have performed pyrosequencing of
the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes in this study to determine the diversity and 
breadth of the intestinal microbial species. Our findings indicate that the
microbial composition of the intestinal lumen differs significantly between
control and tumor groups. The abundance of Firmicutes was elevated whereas the
abundance of Bacteroidetes and Spirochetes was reduced in the lumen of CRC rats. 
Fusobacteria was not detected in any of the healthy rats and there was no
significant difference in observed Proteobacteria species when comparing the
bacterial communities between our two groups. Interestingly, the abundance of
Proteobacteria was higher in CRC rats. At the genus level, Bacteroides exhibited 
a relatively higher abundance in CRC rats compared to controls (14.92% vs. 9.22%,
p<0.001). Meanwhile, Prevotella (55.22% vs. 26.19%), Lactobacillus (3.71% vs.
2.32%) and Treponema (3.04% vs. 2.43%), were found to be significantly more
abundant in healthy rats than CRC rats (p<0.001, respectively). We also
demonstrate a significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria such as
Roseburia and Eubacterium in the gut microbiota of CRC rats. Furthermore, a
significant increase in Desulfovibrio, Erysipelotrichaceae and Fusobacterium was 
also observed in the tumor group. A decrease in probiotic species such as
Ruminococcus and Lactobacillus was likewise observed in the tumor group.
Collectively, we can conclude that a significant difference in intestinal
bacterial flora exists between healthy rats and CRC rats.

BACKGROUND: A colorectal tumor is not an isolated entity growing in a restricted 
location of the body. The patient's gut environment constitutes the framework
where the tumor evolves and this relationship promotes and includes a complex and
tight correlation of the tumor with inflammation, blood vessels formation,
nutrition, and gut microbiome composition. The tumor influence in the environment
could both promote an anti-tumor or a pro-tumor response.
METHODS: A set of 98 paired adjacent mucosa and tumor tissues from colorectal
cancer (CRC) patients and 50 colon mucosa from healthy donors (246 samples in
total) were included in this work. RNA extracted from each sample was hybridized 
in Affymetrix chips Human Genome U219. Functional relationships between genes
were inferred by means of systems biology using both transcriptional regulation
networks (ARACNe algorithm) and protein-protein interaction networks (BIANA
software).
RESULTS: Here we report a transcriptomic analysis revealing a number of genes
activated in adjacent mucosa from CRC patients, not activated in mucosa from
healthy donors. A functional analysis of these genes suggested that this active
reaction of the adjacent mucosa was related to the presence of the tumor.
Transcriptional and protein-interaction networks were used to further elucidate
this response of normal gut in front of the tumor, revealing a crosstalk between 
proteins secreted by the tumor and receptors activated in the adjacent colon
tissue; and vice versa. Remarkably, Slit family of proteins activated ROBO
receptors in tumor whereas tumor-secreted proteins transduced a cellular signal
finally activating AP-1 in adjacent tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: The systems-level approach provides new insights into the
micro-ecology of colorectal tumorogenesis. Disrupting this intricate molecular
network of cell-cell communication and pro-inflammatory microenvironment could be
a therapeutic target in CRC patients.

SCOPE: Urolithins are bioactive metabolites produced by the gut microbiota from
ellagitannins (ETs) and ellagic acid (EA). We investigated whether urolithins
could be detected in colon tissues from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients after
pomegranate extract (PE) intake.
METHODS AND RESULTS: CRC patients (n = 52) were divided into controls and PEs
consumers (900 mg/day for 15 days) before surgical resection. PEs with low (PE-1)
and high (PE-2) punicalagin:EA ratio were administered. Twenty-three metabolites,
but no ellagitannins, were detected in urine, plasma, normal (NT) or malignant
(MT) colon tissues using UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS (UPLC, ultra performance liquid
chromatography; QTOF, quadrupole TOF). Free EA, five EA conjugates, gallic acid
and 12 urolithin derivatives were found in colon tissues. Individual and total
metabolites levels were higher in NT than in MT, independently of the PE
consumed. The maximal mean concentration (1671 ± 367 ng/g) was found in NT after 
consumption of PE-1 and the lowest concentration (42.4 ± 10.2 ng/g) in MT with
PE-2. Urolithin A or isourolithin A were the main urolithins produced (54 and 46%
patients with urolithin A or isourolithin A phenotype, respectively). High
punicalagin content (PE-2) hampered urolithins formation.
CONCLUSION: Significant levels of EA derivatives and urolithins are found in
human colon tissues from CRC patients after consumption of pomegranate. Further
studies are warranted to elucidate their biological activity.

Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are at a higher risk of colorectal cancer 
(CRC). The objective of our study was to examine the inter-relationship among
infection sites, systemic antibiotic use and risk of CRC among patients with Type
2 diabetes mellitus. From a diabetic cohort from the Taiwan's National Health
Insurance claims database, we identified 3,593 incident colon cancer cases, 1,979
rectal cancer cases and 22,288 controls and conducted a nested case-control study
to examine the association between antibiotic use and CRC incidence. Logistic
regression models were applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and the 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) between infection sites, antibiotic use and CRC
incidence. Patients with intra-abdominal infection were significantly associated 
with increased risk for colon cancer (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.73-2.35) and rectal
cancer (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.26-2.00). Any antianaerobic antibiotic use was
associated with a higher risk of colon cancer (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 2.12-2.52) and
rectal cancer (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.50-1.90) but without an obvious
dose-response relationship for cumulative use. Antianaerobic antibiotics also
increased the risks for those with nonintra-abdominal infection. No association
was found between antiaerobic agent use and the CRC risk. The results suggest
intra-abdominal infections and antianaerobic antibiotic use may be a marker for
precancerous lesions or early CRC, although the possibility of antianaerobic
antibiotics playing an additional role cannot be excluded. Further research
examining the relationship between intra-abdominal infection, antianaerobic
antibiotics use and possible change of microbiota leading to colorectal
carcinogenesis is warranted.

CPT-11 is a drug used as chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. CPT-11 causes toxic 
side-effects in patients. CPT-11 toxicity has been attributed to the activity of 
intestinal microbiota, however, intestinal microbiota may also have protective
effects in CP!-11 chemotherapy. This study aimed to elucidate mechanisms through 
which microbiota and dietary fibres could modify host health. Rats bearing a Ward
colon carcinoma were treated with a two-cycle CPT-11/5-fluorouracil therapy
recapitulating clinical therapy of colorectal cancer. Animals were fed with a
semi-purified diet or a semi-purified diet was supplemented with non-digestible
carbohydrates (isomalto-oligosaccharides, resistant starch,
fructo-oligosaccharides, or inulin) in 3 independent experiments. Changes in
intestinal microbiota, bacteria translocating to mesenteric lymphnodes, cecal GUD
activity, and cecal SCFA production, and the intestinal concentration of CPT-11
and its metabolites were analysed. Non-digestible carbohydrates significantly
influenced feed intake, body weight and other indicators of animal health. The
identification of translocating bacteria and their quantification in cecal
microbiota indicated that overgrowth of the intestine by opportunistic pathogens 
was not a major contributor to CPT-11 toxicity. Remarkably, fecal GUD activity
positively correlated to body weight and feed intake but negatively correlated to
cecal SN-38 concentrations and IL1-β. The reduction in CPT-11 toxicity by
non-digestible carbohydrates did not correlate to stimulation of specific
bacterial taxa. However, cecal butyrate concentrations and feed intake were
highly correlated. The protective role of intestinal butyrate production was
substantiated by a positive correlation of the host expression of MCT1
(monocarboxylate transporter 1) with body weight as well as a positive
correlation of the abundance of bacterial butyryl-CoA gene with cecal butyrate
concentrations. These correlations support the interpretation that the influence 
of dietary fibre on CPT-11 toxicity is partially mediated by an increased cecal
production of butyrate.

BACKGROUND: Numerous cancers have been linked to microorganisms. Given that
colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths and the colon is
continuously exposed to a high diversity of microbes, the relationship between
gut mucosal microbiome and colorectal cancer needs to be explored. Metagenomic
studies have shown an association between Fusobacterium species and colorectal
carcinoma. Here, we have extended these studies with deeper sequencing of a much 
larger number (n = 130) of colorectal carcinoma and matched normal control
tissues. We analyzed these data using co-occurrence networks in order to identify
microbe-microbe and host-microbe associations specific to tumors.
RESULTS: We confirmed tumor over-representation of Fusobacterium species and
observed significant co-occurrence within individual tumors of Fusobacterium,
Leptotrichia and Campylobacter species. This polymicrobial signature was
associated with over-expression of numerous host genes, including the gene
encoding the pro-inflammatory chemokine Interleukin-8. The tumor-associated
bacteria we have identified are all Gram-negative anaerobes, recognized
previously as constituents of the oral microbiome, which are capable of causing
infection. We isolated a novel strain of Campylobacter showae from a colorectal
tumor specimen. This strain is substantially diverged from a previously sequenced
oral Campylobacter showae isolate, carries potential virulence genes, and
aggregates with a previously isolated tumor strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
CONCLUSIONS: A polymicrobial signature of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria is
associated with colorectal carcinoma tissue.

Intestinal homeostasis depends on the proper activity of the intestinal stem
cells (ISCs) and an appropriate host response to the normal resident microbiota. 
The question on the effect of microbiota on ISCs behavior has not been addressed 
yet. Canonical Wnt pathway and ISC gene expression signature was compared in
germfree vs. conventional and MyD88(-/-) vs. Myd88(+/+) mice based on publicly
available gene expression data sets. Microbiota and MyD88-dependent signaling
have distinct effects on the Wnt pathway and ISC at gene expression level. In
addition, the effect of microbiota and MyD88-dependent signaling on Wnt pathway
and ISCs show regional variation. The net effect of microbiota on Wnt pathway and
ISCs cannot be inferred from the available data. Nonetheless, the data are
suggestive of a potential regulatory mechanism of the Wnt pathway by the
microbiota and plausibly by any alteration in the microbiota composition.

Although the microbiota has been shown to drive production of interleukin-17A
(IL-17A) from T helper 17 cells to promote cell proliferation and tumor growth in
colorectal cancer, the molecular mechanisms for microbiota-mediated regulation of
tumorigenesis are largely unknown. Here, we found that the innate-like cytokine
IL-17C was upregulated in human colorectal cancers and in mouse intestinal tumor 
models. Alterations in the microbiota drove IL-17C upregulation specifically in
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) through Toll-like receptor
(TLR)-MyD88-dependent signaling during intestinal tumorigenesis.
Microbiota-driven IL-17C induced Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression in IECs in an
autocrine manner to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis in both chemically
induced and spontaneous intestinal tumor models. Thus, IL-17C promotes cancer
development by increasing IEC survival, and the microbiota can mediate cancer
pathogenesis through regulation of IL-17C.

Fusobacterium species are part of the gut microbiome in humans. Recent studies
have identified overrepresentation of Fusobacterium in colorectal cancer tissues,
but it is not yet clear whether this is pathogenic or simply an epiphenomenon. In
this study, we evaluated the relationship between Fusobacterium status and
molecular features in colorectal cancers through quantitative real-time PCR in
149 colorectal cancer tissues, 89 adjacent normal appearing mucosae and 72
colonic mucosae from cancer-free individuals. Results were correlated with CpG
island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status, microsatellite instability (MSI), and 
mutations in BRAF, KRAS, TP53, CHD7, and CHD8. Whole-exome capture sequencing
data were also available in 11 cases. Fusobacterium was detectable in 111 of 149 
(74%) colorectal cancer tissues and heavily enriched in 9% (14/149) of the cases.
As expected, Fusobacterium was also detected in normal appearing mucosae from
both cancer and cancer-free individuals, but the amount of bacteria was much
lower compared with colorectal cancer tissues (a mean of 250-fold lower for
Pan-fusobacterium). We found the Fusobacterium-high colorectal cancer group
(FB-high) to be associated with CIMP positivity (P = 0.001), TP53 wild-type (P = 
0.015), hMLH1 methylation positivity (P = 0.0028), MSI (P = 0.018), and CHD7/8
mutation positivity (P = 0.002). Among the 11 cases where whole-exome sequencing 
data were available, two that were FB-high cases also had the highest number of
somatic mutations (a mean of 736 per case in FB-high vs. 225 per case in all
others). Taken together, our findings show that Fusobacterium enrichment is
associated with specific molecular subsets of colorectal cancers, offering
support for a pathogenic role in colorectal cancer for this gut microbiome
component.

BACKGROUND: Colonic polyps are common tumors occurring in ~50% of Western
populations with ~10% risk of malignant progression. Dietary agents have been
considered the primary environmental exposure to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) 
development. However, the colonic mucosa is permanently in contact with the
microbiota and its metabolic products including toxins that also have the
potential to trigger oncogenic transformation.
AIM: To analyze fecal DNA for microbiota composition and functional potential in 
African Americans with pre-neoplastic lesions.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We analyzed the bacterial composition of stool samples from 
6 healthy individuals and 6 patients with colon polyps using 16S ribosomal
RNA-based phylogenetic microarray; the Human intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) and 
16S rRNA gene barcoded 454 pyrosequencing. The functional potential was
determined by sequence-based metagenomics using 454 pyrosequencing.
RESULTS: Fecal microbiota profiling of samples from the healthy and polyp
patients using both a phylogenetic microarraying (HITChip) and barcoded 454
pyrosequencing generated similar results. A distinction between both sets of
samples was only obtained when the analysis was performed at the sub-genus level.
Most of the species leading to the dissociation were from the Bacteroides group. 
The metagenomic analysis did not reveal major differences in bacterial gene
prevalence/abundances between the two groups even when the analysis and
comparisons were restricted to available Bacteroides genomes.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that at the pre-neoplastic stages, there is a
trend showing microbiota changes between healthy and colon polyp patients at the 
sub-genus level. These differences were not reflected at the genome/functions
levels. Bacteria and associated functions within the Bacteroides group need to be
further analyzed and dissected to pinpoint potential actors in the early colon
oncogenic transformation in a large sample size.

PURPOSE: The intestinal microbiota is potentially involved in the development of 
colorectal carcinoma via various mechanisms. Escherichia coli are commensal
bacteria of the human gut microbiota, but some pathogenic strains have acquired
the ability to induce chronic inflammation and/or produce toxins, such as
cyclomodulin, which could participate in the carcinogenesis process. Here, we
analyzed the E. coli population associated with mucosa of patients with colon
cancer in relation to clinicopathologic characteristics. We assessed carcinogenic
properties of a colon cancer-associated E. coli strain in multiple intestinal
neoplasia (Min) mice.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mucosa-associated or internalized E. coli were quantified
and characterized from tumors and mucosa of patients with colon cancer and the
healthy mucosa of diverticulosis controls. Min mice were inoculated with a colon 
cancer-associated E. coli strain (11G5). The number of colonic polyps was
evaluated at 7 weeks after infection.
RESULTS: An increased level of mucosa-associated and internalized E. coli was
observed in the tumors compared with normal tissue. A relationship between poor
prognostic factors for colon cancer (tumor-node-metastasis stage) and
colonization of mucosa by E. coli was observed. Pathogenic cyclomodulin-positive 
E. coli strains were more prevalent on mucosa of patients with stages III/IV than
those with stage I colon cancer. Proliferative index and E. coli colonization
level of the mucosa distant from the tumor significantly correlated. Min mice
infected with the E. coli strain 11G5 displayed a marked increase in the number
of visible colonic polyps compared with controls.
CONCLUSION: These findings support that pathogenic E. coli could be a cofactor in
pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.

We tested the hypothesis that an altered community of gut microbes is associated 
with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a study of 47 CRC case subjects and 94
control subjects. 16S rRNA genes in fecal bacterial DNA were amplified by
universal primers, sequenced by 454 FLX technology, and aligned for taxonomic
classification to microbial genomes using the QIIME pipeline. Taxonomic
differences were confirmed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
adjusted for false discovery rate. All statistical tests were two-sided. From
794217 16S rRNA gene sequences, we found that CRC case subjects had decreased
overall microbial community diversity (P = .02). In taxonomy-based analyses,
lower relative abundance of Clostridia (68.6% vs 77.8%) and increased carriage of
Fusobacterium (multivariable odds ratio [OR] = 4.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]
= 1.62 to 10.47) and Porphyromonas (OR = 5.17; 95% CI = 1.75 to 15.25) were found
in case subjects compared with control subjects. Because of the potentially
modifiable nature of the gut bacteria, our findings may have implications for CRC
prevention.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide with colorectal cancer (CRC) ranking
as the third contributing to overall cancer mortality. Non-digestible compounds
such as dietary fiber have been inversely associated with CRC in epidemiological 
in vivo and in vitro studies. In order to investigate the effect of fermentation 
products from a whole non-digestible fraction of common bean versus the
short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) on colon cancer cells, we evaluated the human gut 
microbiota fermented non-digestible fraction (hgm-FNDF) of cooked common bean
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivar Negro 8025 and a synthetic mixture SCFAs,
mimicking their concentration in the lethal concentration 50 (SCFA-LC50) of FNDF 
(hgm-FNDF-LC50), on the molecular changes in human colon adenocarcinoma cells
(HT-29). Total mRNA from hgm-FNDF-LC50 and SCFA-LC50 treated HT-29 cells were
used to perform qPCR arrays to determine the effect of the treatments on the
transcriptional expression of 84 genes related to the p53-pathway. This study
showed that both treatments inhibited cell proliferation in accordance with
modulating RB1, CDC2, CDC25A, NFKB and E2F genes. Furthermore, we found an
association between the induction of apoptosis and the modulation of APAF1, BID, 
CASP9, FASLG, TNFR10B and BCL2A genes. The results suggest a mechanism of action 
by which the fermentation of non-digestible compounds of common bean exert a
beneficial effect better than the SCFA mixture by modulating the expression of
antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic genes in HT-29 cells to a greater extent,
supporting previous results on cell behavior, probably due to the participation
of other compounds, such as phenolic fatty acids derivatives and biopetides.

Recent studies have shown that individuals with colorectal cancer have an altered
gut microbiome compared to healthy controls. It remains unclear whether these
differences are a response to tumorigenesis or actively drive tumorigenesis. To
determine the role of the gut microbiome in the development of colorectal cancer,
we characterized the gut microbiome in a murine model of inflammation-associated 
colorectal cancer that mirrors what is seen in humans. We followed the
development of an abnormal microbial community structure associated with
inflammation and tumorigenesis in the colon. Tumor-bearing mice showed enrichment
in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with members of the Bacteroides,
Odoribacter, and Akkermansia genera and decreases in OTUs affiliated with members
of the Prevotellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families. Conventionalization of
germfree mice with microbiota from tumor-bearing mice significantly increased
tumorigenesis in the colon compared to that for animals colonized with a healthy 
gut microbiome from untreated mice. Furthermore, at the end of the model,
germfree mice colonized with microbiota from tumor-bearing mice harbored a higher
relative abundance of populations associated with tumor formation in conventional
animals. Manipulation of the gut microbiome with antibiotics resulted in a
dramatic decrease in both the number and size of tumors. Our results demonstrate 
that changes in the gut microbiome associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis
directly contribute to tumorigenesis and suggest that interventions affecting the
composition of the microbiome may be a strategy to prevent the development of
colon cancer.IMPORTANCE: The trillions of bacteria that live in the gut, known
collectively as the gut microbiome, are important for normal functioning of the
intestine. There is now growing evidence that disruptive changes in the gut
microbiome are strongly associated with the development colorectal cancer.
However, how the gut microbiome changes with time during tumorigenesis and
whether these changes directly contribute to disease have not been determined. We
demonstrate using a mouse model of inflammation-driven colon cancer that there
are dramatic, continual alterations in the microbiome during the development of
tumors, which are directly responsible for tumor development. Our results suggest
that interventions that target these changes in the microbiome may be an
effective strategy for preventing the development of colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: A clinical study was designed that aimed to analyze whether resection
of the large bowel in cancer patients might benefit diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: This prospective case-control study included retrospective information. 
Patients (n = 247) included diabetic and euglycemic groups with colorectal cancer
operations (n = 60), cancer gastrectomy (n = 72), exclusive chemoradiotherapy for
rectal cancer (n = 46), and noncancer clinical controls (n = 69). Follow-up
periods were, respectively, 79.2 ± 27.4, 86.8 ± 25.1, 70.0 ± 26.3, and 85.1 ±
18.2 months (NS). Diabetes groups included patients with prediabetes.
RESULTS: Diabetes remission, defined as conversion from diabetes to prediabetes
or from this condition to normal, was documented in, respectively, 32.4 % (11 of 
34), 41.2 % (14 of 34), 7.1 % (1 of 14), and 7.7 % (3 of 39) in the four cohorts 
(P = 0.004). Within the same period, progression of euglycemic participants to
diabetes occurred in 30.8 % (8 of 26), 63.2 % (24 of 38), 25.0 (8 of 32), and
20.0 % (6 of 30) (P = 0.028). Diabetes amelioration was associated with weight
loss in gastrectomy patients but not in the other groups. Dietary intake,
estimated in the two surgical populations, did not predict outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes amelioration after colorectal interventions was
demonstrated, but progression of euglycemic patients toward prediabetes was not
changed in comparison with nonsurgical controls. It is speculated that reshaping 
of the bowel microbiome or hormone changes after colorectal interventions
underlay the improvement in diabetes. Body weight fluctuations could not be
incriminated in this investigation.

Enterotoxigenic anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis is a significant source of
inflammatory diarrheal disease and a risk factor for colorectal cancer. Two
distinct metalloproteinase types (the homologous 1, 2, and 3 isoforms of
fragilysin (FRA1, FRA2, and FRA3, respectively) and metalloproteinase II (MPII)) 
are encoded by the B. fragilis pathogenicity island. FRA was demonstrated to be
important to pathogenesis, whereas MPII, also a potential virulence protein,
remained completely uncharacterized. Here, we, for the first time, extensively
characterized MPII in comparison with FRA3, a representative of the FRA isoforms.
We employed a series of multiplexed peptide cleavage assays to determine
substrate specificity and proteolytic characteristics of MPII and FRA. These
results enabled implementation of an efficient assay of MPII activity using a
fluorescence-quenched peptide and contributed to structural evidence for the
distinct substrate cleavage preferences of MPII and FRA. Our data imply that MPII
specificity mimics the dibasic Arg↓Arg cleavage motif of furin-like proprotein
convertases, whereas the cleavage motif of FRA (Pro-X-X-Leu-(Arg/Ala/Leu)↓)
resembles that of human matrix metalloproteinases. To the best of our knowledge, 
MPII is the first zinc metalloproteinase with the dibasic cleavage preferences,
suggesting a high level of versatility of metalloproteinase proteolysis. Based on
these data, we now suggest that the combined (rather than individual) activity of
MPII and FRA is required for the overall B. fragilis virulence in vivo.

Although probiotics have shown success in preventing the development of
experimental colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC), beneficial effects of
interventional treatment are relatively unknown. Here we show that interventional
treatment with VSL#3 probiotic alters the luminal and mucosally-adherent
microbiota, but does not protect against inflammation or tumorigenesis in the
azoxymethane (AOM)/Il10⁻/⁻ mouse model of colitis-associated CRC. VSL#3
(10⁹ CFU/animal/day) significantly enhanced tumor penetrance, multiplicity,
histologic dysplasia scores, and adenocarcinoma invasion relative to
VSL#3-untreated mice. Illumina 16S sequencing demonstrated that VSL#3
significantly decreased (16-fold) the abundance of a bacterial taxon assigned to 
genus Clostridium in the mucosally-adherent microbiota. Mediation analysis by
linear models suggested that this taxon was a contributing factor to increased
tumorigenesis in VSL#3-fed mice. We conclude that VSL#3 interventional therapy
can alter microbial community composition and enhance tumorigenesis in the
AOM/Il10⁻/⁻ model.

Increasing evidence links the gut microbiota with colorectal cancer. Metagenomic 
analyses indicate that symbiotic Fusobacterium spp. are associated with human
colorectal carcinoma, but whether this is an indirect or causal link remains
unclear. We find that Fusobacterium spp. are enriched in human colonic adenomas
relative to surrounding tissues and in stool samples from colorectal adenoma and 
carcinoma patients compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, in the Apc(Min/+) 
mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis, Fusobacterium nucleatum increases tumor 
multiplicity and selectively recruits tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, which can
promote tumor progression. Tumors from Apc(Min/+) mice exposed to F. nucleatum
exhibit a proinflammatory expression signature that is shared with human
fusobacteria-positive colorectal carcinomas. However, unlike other bacteria
linked to colorectal carcinoma, F. nucleatum does not exacerbate colitis,
enteritis, or inflammation-associated intestinal carcinogenesis. Collectively,
these data suggest that, through recruitment of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, 
fusobacteria generate a proinflammatory microenvironment that is conducive for
colorectal neoplasia progression.

In this study we used stool profiling to identify intestinal bacteria and
metabolites that are differentially represented in humans with colorectal cancer 
(CRC) compared to healthy controls to identify how microbial functions may
influence CRC development. Stool samples were collected from healthy adults
(n = 10) and colorectal cancer patients (n = 11) prior to colon resection surgery
at the University of Colorado Health-Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, CO. 
The V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene was pyrosequenced and both short chain fatty
acids and global stool metabolites were extracted and analyzed utilizing Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). There were no significant differences
in the overall microbial community structure associated with the disease state,
but several bacterial genera, particularly butyrate-producing species, were
under-represented in the CRC samples, while a mucin-degrading species,
Akkermansia muciniphila, was about 4-fold higher in CRC (p<0.01). Proportionately
higher amounts of butyrate were seen in stool of healthy individuals while
relative concentrations of acetate were higher in stools of CRC patients. GC-MS
profiling revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples from CRC
patients and higher poly and monounsaturated fatty acids and ursodeoxycholic
acid, a conjugated bile acid in stool samples from healthy adults (p<0.01).
Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential
relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species. These
associations could provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer
environment and will help direct future mechanistic studies. Using integrated
"omics" approaches may prove a useful tool in identifying functional groups of
gastrointestinal bacteria and their associated metabolites as novel therapeutic
and chemopreventive targets.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a frequently used osmotic laxative that accelerates 
gastrointestinal transit. It has remained unclear, however, whether PEG affects
intestinal functions. We aimed to determine the effect of PEG treatment on
intestinal sterol metabolism. Rats were treated with PEG in drinking water (7%)
for 2 wk or left untreated (controls). We studied the enterohepatic circulation
of the major bile salt (BS) cholate with a plasma stable isotope dilution
technique and determined BS profiles and concentrations in bile, intestinal lumen
contents, and feces. We determined the fecal excretion of cholesterol plus its
intestinally formed metabolites. Finally, we determined the cytolytic activity of
fecal water (a surrogate marker of colorectal cancer risk) and the amount and
composition of fecal microbiota. Compared with control rats, PEG treatment
increased the pool size (+51%; P < 0.01) and decreased the fractional turnover of
cholate (-32%; P < 0.01). PEG did not affect the cholate synthesis rate,
corresponding with an unaffected fecal primary BS excretion. PEG reduced fecal
excretion of secondary BS and of cholesterol metabolites (each P < 0.01). PEG
decreased the cytolytic activity of fecal water [54 (46-62) vs. 87 (85-92)%
erythrocyte potassium release in PEG-treated and control rats, respectively; P < 
0.01]. PEG treatment increased the contribution of Verrucomicrobia (P < 0.01) and
decreased that of Firmicutes (P < 0.01) in fecal flora. We concluded that PEG
treatment changes the intestinal bacterial composition, decreases the bacterial
dehydroxylation of primary BS and the metabolism of cholesterol, and increases
the pool size of the primary BS cholate in rats.

BACKGROUND: There have been very few detailed reports of the intestinal
environment after surgical treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC). We analysed
faecal microbiota, organic acids and pH to investigate the influence of
colorectal surgery on the intestinal environment.
METHODS: Faecal samples from 81 CRC patients were collected before the start of
pre-operative preparation the day before surgery, as well as 7 days or more after
surgery. Thirteen groups of intestinal microbiota, eight types of organic acids, 
and pH were measured using 16S rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative
PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography and a pH meter, respectively.
RESULTS: Total bacterial counts (10.3 ± 0.6 vs. 9.4 ± 1.2 log10 cells/g;
p < 0.001) and the numbers of 6 groups of obligate anaerobes were significantly
decreased after surgery. In contrast, the populations of Enterobacteriaceae,
Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas were significantly increased.
Post-operatively, the concentration of total organic acids was lower (77.9 ± 40.1
vs. 50.1 ± 37.0 μmol/g; p < 0.001) than the pre-operative concentration, and a
significant reduction in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was observed.
CONCLUSION: Significant changes in the intestinal environment, including marked
decreases in obligate anaerobes, increases in pathogenic bacteria, and reductions
in SCFAs, were detected after surgery for CRC.

The gut flora is composed of a huge number of diverse, well-adapted symbionts
that interact with epithelial lining throughout the host's entire life. Not all
commensals have the same ability to maintain quiescent, protective inflammation. 
Importantly, instability in the composition of gut microbial communities
(referred to as dysbiosis) has been linked to loss of gut barrier in the context 
of common human illnesses with increasing socio-economic impacts, such as Crohn
disease and colorectal cancer. Our recent findings suggest that
disease-predisposing dysbiosis can now be intentionally manipulated by targeting 
the major Crohn disease-predisposing NOD2 gene. That knowledge will not only add 
a new dimension to the often overlooked microbiology of Crohn disease and
colorectal cancer, but will also have a broad impact on biomedical sciences
worldwide.

Reduced susceptibility to sporadic colorectal cancer in native Africans (NA) is
correlated with low consumption of animal products and greater microbial
production of colonic methane. In this context, two hydrogenotrophic microbial
groups are of interest, methanogenic Archaea (MA) utilizing H2 to produce methane
and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) generating hydrogen sulfide, which has been
linked with chronic inflammatory disorders of the colon. In the present study,
stool samples from NA, consuming a diet high in resistant starch and low in
animal products, and from African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA),
both consuming a typical Western diet, were examined for genetic diversity and
structure of Archaea, MA and SRB communities. In general, a greater proportion of
NA than AA and EA harboured the full range of targeted hydrogenotrophic groups.
Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rRNA genes and 
specific functional genes, combined with multivariate statistical analyses,
revealed that NA harboured more diverse and different Archaea and MA populations 
than AA and EA. Also, NA harboured significantly distinct SRB populations
compared with AA and EA. Taken together, these data are consistent with diet
selecting for distinct hydrogenotrophic microbiota.

The human gut microbiota is a complex system that is essential to the health of
the host. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may play an
important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we 
used pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region to characterize the fecal
microbiota of 19 patients with CRC and 20 healthy control subjects. The results
revealed striking differences in fecal microbial population patterns between
these two groups. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed that 17
phylotypes closely related to Bacteroides were enriched in the gut microbiota of 
CRC patients, whereas nine operational taxonomic units, represented by the
butyrate-producing genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, were significantly less
abundant. A positive correlation was observed between the abundance of
Bacteroides species and CRC disease status (R = 0.462, P = 0.046 < 0.5). In
addition, 16 genera were significantly more abundant in CRC samples than in
controls, including potentially pathogenic Fusobacterium and Campylobacter
species at genus level. The dysbiosis of fecal microbiota, characterized by the
enrichment of potential pathogens and the decrease in butyrate-producing members,
may therefore represent a specific microbial signature of CRC. A greater
understanding of the dynamics of the fecal microbiota may assist in the
development of novel fecal microbiome-related diagnostic tools for CRC.

The microbiota is pivotal in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD)-associated inflammation-induced colorectal cancer (CRC), yet mechanisms for
these effects remain poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that aberrant
inflammasome-induced microbiota plays a critical role in CRC development, where
mice deficient in the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 (NLRP6) 
inflammasome feature enhanced inflammation-induced CRC formation. Intriguingly,
WT mice cohoused either with inflammasome-deficient mice or with mice lacking
IL-18 feature exacerbated inflammation-induced CRC compared with singly housed WT
mice. Enhanced tumorigenesis is dependent on microbiota-induced chemokine (C-C
motif) ligand 5 (CCL5)-driven inflammation, which in turn promotes epithelial
cell proliferation through local activation of the IL-6 pathway, leading to
cancer formation. Altogether, our results mechanistically link the altered
microbiota with the pathogenesis of inflammation-induced CRC and suggest that in 
some conditions, microbiota components may transfer CRC susceptibility between
individuals.

Recent studies suggest that biofluid-based metabonomics may identify metabolite
markers promising for colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. We report here a
follow-up replication study, after a previous CRC metabonomics study, aiming to
identify a distinct serum metabolic signature of CRC with diagnostic potential.
Serum metabolites from newly diagnosed CRC patients (N = 101) and healthy
subjects (N = 102) were profiled using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS). Differential metabolites were
identified with statistical tests of orthogonal partial
least-squares-discriminant analysis (VIP > 1) and the Mann-Whitney U test (p <
0.05). With a total of 249 annotated serum metabolites, we were able to
differentiate CRC patients from the healthy controls using an orthogonal partial 
least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) in a learning sample set of 62 CRC 
patients and 62 matched healthy controls. This established model was able to
correctly assign the rest of the samples to the CRC or control groups in a
validation set of 39 CRC patients and 40 healthy controls. Consistent with our
findings from the previous study, we observed a distinct metabolic signature in
CRC patients including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, glutamine,
fatty acids, and gut flora metabolism. Our results demonstrated that a panel of
serum metabolite markers is of great potential as a noninvasive diagnostic method
for the detection of CRC.

The purpose of this study was to determine in healthy humans whether First Leaf
(FL; composed of blackcurrant extract powder, lactoferrin and lutein) and Cassis 
Anthomix 30 (CAM30; blackcurrant extract powder) can positively modify the
colonic microbiota by enhancing the growth of the beneficial bacteria and
inactivating the toxic bacterial enzymes which are known to be involved in
colonic carcinogenesis. Thirty healthy adult male and female volunteers were
recruited for this study. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was carried out to
analyse the populations of fecal microbiota. Consumption of FL and CAM30 led to
significant increases (P < 0.0001) in the population sizes of lactobacilli and
bifidobacteria whereas the population sizes of Clostridium spp. and Bacteroides
spp were decreased significantly (P < 0.0001). In addition, feeding of FL and
CAM30 decreases the activity of β-glucuronidase (bacterial enzyme which is
considered to be one of the enzymes that increases risk for colorectal cancer)
and significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the fecal pH. In conclusion, the results
of this study open up the possibility that consumption of FL and CAM30 can offer 
various benefits to human health through acting as novel prebiotic agents via
increasing the numbers of beneficial bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria)
in the gut.

A novel method for the culture and polarized stimulation of human intestinal
mucosa explants.

Few models currently exist to realistically simulate the complex human
intestine's micro-environment, where a variety of interactions take place. Proper
homeostasis directly depends on these interactions, as they shape an entire
immunological response inducing tolerance against food antigens while at the same
time mounting effective immune responses against pathogenic microbes accidentally
ingested with food. Intestinal homeostasis is preserved also through various
complex interactions between the microbiota (including food-associated beneficial
bacterial strains) and the host, that regulate the attachment/degradation of
mucus, the production of antimicrobial peptides by the epithelial barrier, and
the "education" of epithelial cells' that controls the tolerogenic or immunogenic
phenotype of unique, gut-resident lymphoid cells' populations. These interactions
have been so far very difficult to reproduce with in vitro assays using either
cultured cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, mouse
models differ substantially in components of the intestinal mucosa (mucus layer
organization, commensal bacteria community) with respect to the human gut. Thus, 
studies of a variety of treatments to be brought in the clinics for important
stress-related or pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome,
inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer have been difficult to carry out.
To address these issues, we developed a novel system that enables us to stimulate
explants of human intestinal mucosa that retain their in situ conditioning by the
host microbiota and immune response, in a polarized fashion. Polarized apical
stimulation is of great importance for the outcome of the elicited immune
response. It has been repeatedly shown that the same stimuli can produce
completely different responses when they bypass the apical face of the intestinal
epithelium, stimulating epithelial cells basolaterally or coming into direct
contact with lamina propria components, switching the phenotype from tolerogenic 
to immunogenic and causing unnecessary and excessive inflammation in the area. We
achieved polarized stimulation by gluing a cave cylinder which delimited the area
of stimulation on the apical face of the mucosa as will be described in the
protocol. We used this model to examine, among others, differential effects of
three different Lactobacilli strains. We show that this model system is very
powerful to assess the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics in healthy and
disease conditions.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is posing an increasingly important burden on the health 
care system, with western countries seeing a growing incidence of the disease.
Except for germline DNA mutations which have been attributed to less than 5% of
patients, little is known about the main causes of CRC. However, environment
factors such as food, lifestyle and medication are now suspected to have a major 
influence on inducing cancers. Today, exhaustive quantitative and qualitative
evaluation of all environmental factors is not possible. Various
environment-induced diseases have been characterized based on colon microflora,
also called microbiota, analyses. Growing data have shown specific changes in
microflora (i.e. dysbiosis) in the stools of patients with colon cancer or those 
adherent to the colonic mucosa. Thus, it appears that microbiota may be
considered a platform offering host and environment interactions for studying
CRCs. The hypothesis that colon cancer might be a bacteria-related disease is
suggested and perspectives are discussed.

At a simplistic level, colorectal cancer arises from mutations in various
proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Aside from genetically inherited
factors, environmental, lifestyle, and dietary habits have all been identified as
risk agents promoting mutational events leading to the development of colorectal 
cancer. This "In Focus" presents evidence that the intestinal endogenous
bacterial community represents a risk factor for the development of colorectal
cancer.

Disease, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that diet is one of the most
important environmental factors involved in the progression from advanced
colorectal adenoma (A-CRA) to colorectal cancer.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the possible effects of dietary fiber on the fecal
microbiota of patients with A-CRA.
DESIGN: Patients with a diagnosis of A-CRA by pathological examination were
enrolled in the A-CRA group. Patients with no obvious abnormalities or
histopathological changes were enrolled in the healthy control (HC) group.
Dietary fiber intake was assessed in all patients. Short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) in feces were detected by gas chromatography. The fecal microbiota
community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing based on 16S ribosomal RNA.
RESULTS: Lower dietary fiber patterns and consistently lower SCFA production were
observed in the A-CRA group (n = 344). Principal component analysis showed
distinct differences in the fecal microbiota communities of the 2 groups.
Clostridium, Roseburia, and Eubacterium spp. were significantly less prevalent in
the A-CRA group (n = 47) than in the HC group (n = 47), whereas Enterococcus and 
Streptococcus spp. were more prevalent in the A-CRA group (n = 47) (all P <
0.05). Butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria were more prevalent in a subgroup
of HC subjects with a high fiber intake than in those in both the low-fiber HC
subgroup and the high-fiber A-CRA subgroup (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A high-fiber dietary pattern and subsequent consistent production of 
SCFAs and healthy gut microbiota are associated with a reduced risk of A-CRA.

The microbiome has captured the attention of scientists from multiple research
fields including ecology, immunology, microbiology and cancer biology. The
microbial community living in the gastrointestinal tract is the most abundant and
diverse niche of the human body and it is not surprising that microbiome research
has predominantly focused upon this organ system. In this addendum, we summarize 
the latest developments in microbiome research on inflammatory bowel diseases and
colorectal cancer. In addition, we highlight our recent findings that chronic
intestinal inflammation modulates microbial community composition and the
development of colorectal cancer. Our findings redefine the paradigm of
inflammation-associated cancer by illuminating the key role of bacteria in
development of colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to expand existing knowledge about the
CRC-associated microbiome among Han Chinese, and to further discover the
variation pattern of the human CRC microbiome across all population.
FINDINGS: Using pyrosequencing-based molecular monitoring of bacterial 16S rRNA
gene from eight tumor/normal tissue pairs of eight Chinese CRC patients, we
analyzed and characterized the basic features of the CRC-associated microbiome.
Firstly, we discovered an increasing diversity among tumor-associated bacterial
communities. Secondly, in 50% of Chinese CRC patients, we found a significant
increase of Roseburia (P = 0.017), and a concurrent decrease of both
Microbacterium (P = 0.009) and Anoxybacillus (P = 0.009) in tumor tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a novel CRC microbiome pattern in Chinese. Both the
over-represented Roseburia bacteria at tumor sites and the over-represented
Microbacterium and Anoxybacillus bacteria away from tumor sites were both closely
related in Chinese CRC patients. Across several populations reported in this
study and previously, we observed both common and distinctive patterns of human
CRC microbiome's association with a high-risk of CRC.

The mTOR Pathway and the Role of Energy Balance Throughout Life in Colorectal
Cancer Etiology and Prognosis: Unravelling Mechanisms Through a Multidimensional 
Molecular Epidemiologic Approach.

Netherlands.

Timing of exposure to lifestyle factors that influence energy balance may
differentially affect colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and prognosis. Caloric
restriction in youth and short stature, as markers of early-life exposures, have 
shown to decrease CRC risk, whereas large body size and low physical activity
levels in adulthood are established risk factors for CRC. Regarding prognosis,
overweight, sarcopenia, and their co-occurrence (sarcopenic obesity) may
negatively influence the health and quality of life of CRC survivors. There is
mechanistic support for disruption of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway as an underlying mechanism possibly driving these associations, because
mTOR integrates signals from growth factors, nutrients, mutagens, and hormones to
induce cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and autophagy. However,
epidemiologic evidence connecting mTOR to energy-balance-related CRC throughout
the lifespan is scarce. This perspective proposes how multidimensional molecular 
epidemiologic studies can shed light on the etiology and prognosis of
energy-balance-related CRC.

The human gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a player in colorectal
cancer (CRC). While particular imbalances in the gut microbiota have been linked 
to colorectal adenomas and cancer, no specific bacterium has been identified as a
risk factor. Recent studies have reported a high abundance of Fusobacterium in
CRC subjects compared to normal subjects, but this observation has not been
reported for adenomas, CRC precursors. We assessed the abundance of Fusobacterium
species in the normal rectal mucosa of subjects with (n = 48) and without
adenomas (n = 67). We also confirmed previous reports on Fusobacterium and CRC in
10 CRC tumor tissues and 9 matching normal tissues by pyrosequencing. We
extracted DNA from rectal mucosal biopsies and measured bacterial levels by
quantitative PCR of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Local cytokine gene expression
was also determined in mucosal biopsies from adenoma cases and controls by
quantitative PCR. The mean log abundance of Fusobacterium or cytokine gene
expression between cases and controls was compared by t-test. Logistic regression
was used to compare tertiles of Fusobacterium abundance. Adenoma subjects had a
significantly higher abundance of Fusobacterium species compared to controls (p =
0.01). Compared to the lowest tertile, subjects with high abundance of
Fusobacterium were significantly more likely to have adenomas (OR 3.66, 95% CI
1.37-9.74, p-trend 0.005). Cases but not controls had a significant positive
correlation between local cytokine gene expression and Fusobacterium abundance.
Among cases, the correlation for local TNF-α and Fusobacterium was r = 0.33, p = 
0.06 while it was 0.44, p = 0.01 for Fusobacterium and IL-10. These results
support a link between the abundance of Fusobacterium in colonic mucosa and
adenomas and suggest a possible role for mucosal inflammation in this process.

BACKGROUND: New molecular biology-based methods of bacterial identification are
expected to help elucidate the relationship between colorectal cancer (CRC) and
intestinal microbiota. Although there is increasing evidence revealing the
potential role of microbiota in CRC, it remains unclear whether microbial
dysbiosis is the cause or the result of CRC onset.
AIM: We investigated the changes of intestinal environments in CRC or adenoma.
METHODS: We analyzed 13 groups of microbiota, 8 types of organic acids, and pH in
feces obtained from the following 3 groups: individuals with CRC, adenoma, and
non-adenoma. Ninety-three patients with CRC and 49 healthy individuals (22 with
adenoma and 27 without adenoma) were enrolled.
RESULTS: The counts of total bacteria (10.3 ± 0.7 vs. 10.8 ± 0.3 log10 cells/g of
feces; p < 0.001), 5 groups of obligate anaerobe, and 2 groups of facultative
anaerobes were significantly lower in the CRC group than in the healthy
individuals. While the concentrations of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were
significantly decreased in the CRC group, the pH was increased in the CRC group
(7.4 ± 0.8 vs. 6.9 ± 0.6; p < 0.001). Comparison among the CRC, adenoma, and
non-adenoma groups revealed that fecal SCFAs and pH in the adenoma group were
intermediate to the CRC group and the non-adenoma group. Within the CRC group, no
differences in microbiota or organic acids were observed among Dukes stages.
CONCLUSIONS: CRC patients showed significant differences in the intestinal
environment, including alterations of microbiota, decreased SCFAs, and elevated
pH. These changes are not a result of CRC progression but are involved in CRC
onset.

Instability in the composition of gut bacterial communities (dysbiosis) has been 
linked to common human intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease and
colorectal cancer. Here, we show that dysbiosis caused by Nod2 deficiency gives
rise to a reversible, communicable risk of colitis and colitis-associated
carcinogenesis in mice. Loss of either Nod2 or RIP2 resulted in a proinflammatory
microenvironment that enhanced epithelial dysplasia following chemically induced 
injury. The condition could be improved by treatment with antibiotics or an
anti-interleukin-6 receptor-neutralizing antibody. Genotype-dependent disease
risk was communicable via maternally transmitted microbiota in both
Nod2-deficient and WT hosts. Furthermore, reciprocal microbiota transplantation
reduced disease risk in Nod2-deficient mice and led to long-term changes in
intestinal microbial communities. Conversely, disease risk was enhanced in WT
hosts that were recolonized with dysbiotic fecal microbiota from Nod2-deficient
mice. Thus, we demonstrated that licensing of dysbiotic microbiota is a critical 
component of disease risk. Our results demonstrate that NOD2 has an unexpected
role in shaping a protective assembly of gut bacterial communities and suggest
that manipulation of dysbiosis is a potential therapeutic approach in the
treatment of human intestinal disorders.

Microbial pathways in colonic sulfur metabolism and links with health and
disease.

Carbonero F(1), Benefiel AC, Alizadeh-Ghamsari AH, Gaskins HR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Animal Sciences, University of Illinois Urbana, IL, USA.

Sulfur is both crucial to life and a potential threat to health. While colonic
sulfur metabolism mediated by eukaryotic cells is relatively well studied, much
less is known about sulfur metabolism within gastrointestinal microbes. Sulfated 
compounds in the colon are either of inorganic (e.g., sulfates, sulfites) or
organic (e.g., dietary amino acids and host mucins) origin. The most extensively 
studied of the microbes involved in colonic sulfur metabolism are the
sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), which are common colonic inhabitants. Many other
microbial pathways are likely to shape colonic sulfur metabolism as well as the
composition and availability of sulfated compounds, and these interactions need
to be examined in more detail. Hydrogen sulfide is the sulfur derivative that has
attracted the most attention in the context of colonic health, and the extent to 
which it is detrimental or beneficial remains in debate. Several lines of
evidence point to SRB or exogenous hydrogen sulfide as potential players in the
etiology of intestinal disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and
colorectal cancer in particular. Generation of hydrogen sulfide via pathways
other than dissimilatory sulfate reduction may be as, or more, important than
those involving the SRB. We suggest here that a novel axis of research is to
assess the effects of hydrogen sulfide in shaping colonic microbiome structure.
Clearly, in-depth characterization of the microbial pathways involved in colonic 
sulfur metabolism is necessary for a better understanding of its contribution to 
colonic disorders and development of therapeutic strategies.

OBJECTIVE: This paper provides an overview of Desulfovibrio (DSV) incidence and
its effect on bacterial diversity in human gastrointestinal tract of four groups:
ulcerative colitis (UC), colorectal cancer (CRC), polypus (PP) and the healthy
control (H).
METHODS: Real time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) assays were used to
enumerate DSV in gastrointestinal tract of 58 subjects. Diversity of gut
microbiota was analyzed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE)
and 16S rRNA V3 sequencing.
RESULTS: RT-PCR detected DSV in all samples. Significantly increased numbers of
DSV were observed for UC and PP groups compared with CRC and H groups. No
significant difference was observed for CRC and H groups with gene copy numbers
of DSV. Alterations of DSV and gut microbiota were observed in disease groups.
CONCLUSION: We found that quantity and diversity of DSV are significantly
increased in UC and PP compared to controls. The increased numbers of DSV in
disease groups suggests a possible harmful role.

SMAD4 haploinsufficiency associates with augmented colonic inflammation in select
humans and mice.

SMAD4 is a common mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. One of the members 
of this pathway, TGF-beta 1, has an important role in controlling gut
inflammation in relation to the continuous stimulation of the intestinal
microbiota. SMAD4 haploinsufficiency in humans has been linked to juvenile
polyposis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (JP/HHT; OMIM#17505).
Hematochezia and colonic mucosal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD) have been reported in JP/HHT. Stimulated by recent experience with
two affected pediatric patients presented here, we explored the potential role of
Smad4 haploinsufficiency in a murine model of colonic inflammation. Smad4(+/-)
mice were maintained on a mixed C57/129SvEv background. Chronic colitis was
induced with repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking 
water. The colonic mucosal microbiota was interrogated by massively parallel
pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 66.7% of Smad4(+/-) mice were
sensitive to DSS colitis compared to 14.3% of wild type (Chi-Square p=0.036). The
augmented colitis was associated with microbiota separation in the Smad4(+/-)
mice. Enterococcus and Enterococcus faecalis specifically was increased in
abundance in the colitis-prone animals. Smad4 haploinsufficiency can associate
with increased susceptibility to large bowel inflammation in mammals with
variable penetrance in association with the colonic mucosal microbiota. These
findings may reveal implications not only towards colonic inflammation in the
setting of SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, but for colorectal cancer as well.

GOALS: To investigate the association of colonic methane, formed by methanogenic 
achaea, and pH with gastrointestinal symptoms during colorectal cancer
chemotherapy.
BACKGROUND: Adjuvant 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy reduces recurrences in
colorectal cancer, but causes severe gastrointestinal toxicity, partly related to
disturbed intestinal microbiota.
STUDY: Resected colorectal cancer patients (n=143) were analyzed for colonic
methanogenesis and pH before and during the 24 weeks of 5-fluorouracil
chemotherapy and for gastrointestinal symptoms during chemotherapy. This study
was performed within the setting of an intervention study on the effects of
Lactobacillus on chemotherapy-related gastrointestinal toxicity. The site of
resected cancer, resection type, stoma, chemotherapy regimen, hypolactasia, and
Lactobacillus intervention were considered as possible confounding factors, and
multivariate models were constructed.
RESULTS: Baseline methane producers had less frequent diarrhea (more than or
equal to moderate) during chemotherapy than nonproducers [odds ratio (OR), 0.42; 
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20 to 0.88; P=0.022] and more frequent
constipation (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 2.01 to 10.32; P<0.001). Baseline fecal pH was
also associated with symptoms during chemotherapy; higher the pH, the lower the
risk of diarrhea (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.02; P=0.058) and higher the risk of
constipation (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.35 to 3.68; P=0.002). In multivariate stepwise 
models, methanogenesis was a significant explaining factor with inverse
association with diarrhea and positive association with constipation. Fecal pH,
which was significantly associated with methane production, was no longer a
significant explaining factor when methanogensis was included in the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Methane producer status has a role in determining whether patient
experiences diarrhea or constipation during 5-fluorouracil therapy. This
underscores the importance of intestinal microbiota in the development of
intestinal toxicity during 5-fluorouracil therapy.

There is growing evidence the microbiota of the large bowel may influence the
risk of developing colorectal cancer as well as other diseases including type-1
diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome. Current
sampling methods to obtain microbial specimens, such as feces and mucosal
biopsies, are inconvenient and unappealing to patients. Obtaining samples through
rectal swabs could prove to be a quicker and relatively easier method, but it is 
unclear if swabs are an adequate substitute. We compared bacterial diversity and 
composition from rectal swabs and rectal mucosal biopsies in order to examine the
viability of rectal swabs as an alternative to biopsies. Paired rectal swabs and 
mucosal biopsy samples were collected in un-prepped participants (n = 11) and
microbial diversity was characterized by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length
polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbial community composition from swab samples was
different from rectal mucosal biopsies (p = 0.001). Overall the bacterial
diversity was higher in swab samples than in biopsies as assessed by diversity
indexes such as: richness (p = 0.01), evenness (p = 0.06) and Shannon's diversity
(p = 0.04). Analysis of specific bacterial groups by qPCR showed higher copy
number of Lactobacillus (p < 0.0001) and Eubacteria (p = 0.0003) in swab samples 
compared with biopsies. Our findings suggest that rectal swabs and rectal mucosal
samples provide different views of the microbiota in the large intestine.

Inflammation alters host physiology to promote cancer, as seen in
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we identify the intestinal
microbiota as a target of inflammation that affects the progression of CRC.
High-throughput sequencing revealed that inflammation modifies gut microbial
composition in colitis-susceptible interleukin-10-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mice.
Monocolonization with the commensal Escherichia coli NC101 promoted invasive
carcinoma in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated Il10(-/-) mice. Deletion of the
polyketide synthase (pks) genotoxic island from E. coli NC101 decreased tumor
multiplicity and invasion in AOM/Il10(-/-) mice, without altering intestinal
inflammation. Mucosa-associated pks(+) E. coli were found in a significantly high
percentage of inflammatory bowel disease and CRC patients. This suggests that in 
mice, colitis can promote tumorigenesis by altering microbial composition and
inducing the expansion of microorganisms with genotoxic capabilities.

Human intestinal lumen and mucosa-associated microbiota in patients with
colorectal cancer.

China.

Recent reports have suggested the involvement of gut microbiota in the
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). We utilized pyrosequencing based analysis
of 16S rRNA genes to determine the overall structure of microbiota in patients
with colorectal cancer and healthy controls; we investigated microbiota of the
intestinal lumen, the cancerous tissue and matched noncancerous normal tissue.
Moreover, we investigated the mucosa-adherent microbial composition using rectal 
swab samples because the structure of the tissue-adherent bacterial community is 
potentially altered following bowel cleansing. Our findings indicated that the
microbial structure of the intestinal lumen and cancerous tissue differed
significantly. Phylotypes that enhance energy harvest from diets or perform
metabolic exchange with the host were more abundant in the lumen. There were more
abundant Firmicutes and less abundant Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in lumen. 
The overall microbial structures of cancerous tissue and noncancerous tissue were
similar; however the tumor microbiota exhibited lower diversity. The structures
of the intestinal lumen microbiota and mucosa-adherent microbiota were different 
in CRC patients compared to matched microbiota in healthy individuals.
Lactobacillales was enriched in cancerous tissue, whereas Faecalibacterium was
reduced. In the mucosa-adherent microbiota, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium,
and Blautia were reduced in CRC patients, whereas Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas,
Peptostreptococcus, and Mogibacterium were enriched. In the lumen, predominant
phylotypes related to metabolic disorders or metabolic exchange with the host,
Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Coriobacteriaceae were increased in
cancer patients. Coupled with previous reports, these results suggest that the
intestinal microbiota is associated with CRC risk and that intestinal lumen
microflora potentially influence CRC risk via cometabolism or metabolic exchange 
with the host. However, mucosa-associated microbiota potentially affects CRC risk
primarily through direct interaction with the host.

Differences in the composition of the gut microbial community have been
associated with diseases such as obesity, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
colorectal cancer (CRC). We used 454 titanium pyrosequencing of the V1-V2 region 
of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize adherent bacterial communities in mucosal
biopsy samples from 33 subjects with adenomas and 38 subjects without adenomas
(controls). Biopsy samples from subjects with adenomas had greater numbers of
bacteria from 87 taxa than controls; only 5 taxa were more abundant in control
samples. The magnitude of the differences in the distal gut microbiota between
patients with adenomas and controls was more pronounced than that of any other
clinical parameters including obesity, diet or family history of CRC. This
suggests that sequence analysis of the microbiota could be used to identify
patients at risk for developing adenomas.

Chronic intestinal inflammation: inflammatory bowel disease and
colitis-associated colon cancer.

Rubin DC(1), Shaker A, Levin MS.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington
University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory disorders of the intestine. The
prevalence in the United States is greater than 200 cases per 100,000, with the
total number of IBD patients between 1 and 1.5 million. CD may affect all parts
of the gastrointestinal tract, from mouth to anus, but most commonly involves the
distal part of the small intestine or ileum, and colon. UC results in colonic
inflammation that can affect the rectum only, or can progress proximally to
involve part of or the entire colon. Clinical symptoms include diarrhea,
abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and weight loss. A serious long-term
complication of chronic inflammation is the development of colorectal cancer. A
genetic basis for IBD had long been recognized based on the increased familial
risk. However, significant discordance for CD in twins, and a much less robust
phenotypic concordance for UC, suggested additional factors play a role in
disease pathogenesis, including environmental factors. In the past several years,
progress in understanding the molecular basis of IBD has accelerated, beginning
with the generation of animal models of colitis and progressing to the
identification of specific genetic markers from candidate gene, gene linkage, and
genome-wide association analyses. Genetic studies have also resulted in the
recognition of the importance of environmental factors, particularly the crucial 
role of the gut microbiota in CD and UC. Altered immune responses to the normal
intestinal flora are key factors in IBD pathogenesis. In this research topic, the
genetic basis of IBD, the genetic and cellular alterations associated with
colitis-associated colon cancer, and the emerging role of the intestinal
microbiota and other environmental factors will be reviewed.

Numerous studies support a role for the intestinal microbiota in colorectal
tumorigenesis. Although colon cancer has not yet been epidemiologically linked to
specific bacterial species, recent results suggest that certain toxigenic
commensal bacteria may be oncogenic Strains of Escherichia coli, a ubiquitous
member of the colonic flora, synthesize a genotoxin called colibactin. These
bacteria induce DNA double-strand breaks in intestinal cells and trigger
chromosomal instability, gene mutations and cell transformation. Thus, long-term 
colonization of the colon by rogue commensal bacteria capable of causing chronic 
DNA damage could contribute to the development of sporadic colorectal cancer.

Butyrate, an intestinal microbiota metabolite of dietary fiber, has been shown to
exhibit protective effects toward inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative
colitis (UC) and inflammation-mediated colorectal cancer. Recent studies have
shown that chronic IFN-γ signaling plays an essential role in
inflammation-mediated colorectal cancer development in vivo, whereas genome-wide 
association studies have linked human UC risk loci to IFNG, the gene that encodes
IFN-γ. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the butyrate-IFN-γ-colonic
inflammation axis are not well defined. Here we showed that colonic mucosa from
patients with UC exhibit increased signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (STAT1) activation, and this STAT1 hyperactivation is correlated 
with increased T cell infiltration. Butyrate treatment-induced apoptosis of
wild-type T cells but not Fas-deficient (Fas(lpr)) or FasL-deficient (Fas(gld)) T
cells, revealing a potential role of Fas-mediated apoptosis of T cells as a
mechanism of butyrate function. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was found to bind
to the Fas promoter in T cells, and butyrate inhibits HDAC1 activity to induce
Fas promoter hyperacetylation and Fas upregulation in T cells. Knocking down
gpr109a or slc5a8, the genes that encode for receptor and transporter of
butyrate, respectively, resulted in altered expression of genes related to
multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, including inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), in mouse colonic epithelial cells in vivo. Butyrate effectively 
inhibited IFN-γ-induced STAT1 activation, resulting in inhibition of iNOS
upregulation in human colon epithelial and carcinoma cells in vitro. Our data
thus suggest that butyrate delivers a double-hit: induction of T cell apoptosis
to eliminate the source of inflammation and suppression of IFN-γ-mediated
inflammation in colonic epithelial cells, to suppress colonic inflammation.

Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a major contributor of human
colorectal cancer (CRC). While gut microbiota can trigger inflammation in the
intestinal tract, the precise signaling pathways through which host cells respond
to inflammatory bacterial stimulation are unclear. Here, we show that gut
microbiota enhances intestinal tumor load in the APC(Min/+) mouse model of CRC.
Furthermore, systemic anemia occurs coincident with rapid tumor growth,
suggesting a role for intestinal barrier damage and erythropoiesis-stimulating
mitogens. Short-term stimulation assays of murine colonic tumor cells reveal that
lipopolysaccharide, a microbial cell wall component, can accelerate cell growth
via a c-Jun/JNK activation pathway. Colonic tumors are also infiltrated by CD11b+
myeloid cells expressing high levels of phospho-STAT3 (p-Tyr705). Our results
implicate the role of gut microbiota, through triggering the c-Jun/JNK and STAT3 
signaling pathways in combination with anemia, in the acceleration of tumor
growth in APC(Min/+) mice.

colorectum.

OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer is typically classified into proximal colon, distal 
colon and rectal cancer. Tumour genetic and epigenetic features differ by tumour 
location. Considering a possible role of bowel contents (including microbiome) in
carcinogenesis, this study hypothesised that tumour molecular features might
gradually change along bowel subsites, rather than change abruptly at splenic
flexure.
DESIGN: Utilising 1443 colorectal cancers in two US nationwide prospective cohort
studies, the frequencies of molecular features (CpG island methylator phenotype
(CIMP), microsatellite instability (MSI), LINE-1 methylation and BRAF, KRAS and
PIK3CA mutations) were examined along bowel subsites (rectum, rectosigmoid
junction, sigmoid, descending colon, splenic flexure, transverse colon, hepatic
flexure, ascending colon and caecum). The linearity and non-linearity of
molecular relations along subsites were statistically tested by multivariate
logistic or linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: The frequencies of CIMP-high, MSI-high and BRAF mutations gradually
increased from the rectum (<2.3%) to ascending colon (36-40%), followed by falls 
in the caecum (12-22%). By linearity tests, these molecular relations were
significantly linear from rectum to ascending colon (p<0.0001), and there was
little evidence of non-linearity (p>0.09). Caecal cancers exhibited the highest
frequency of KRAS mutations (52% vs 27-35% in other sites; p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The frequencies of CIMP-high, MSI-high and BRAF mutations in cancer 
increased gradually along colorectum subsites from the rectum to ascending colon.
These novel data challenge the common conception of discrete molecular features
of proximal versus distal colorectal cancers, and have a substantial impact on
clinical, translational and epidemiology research, which has typically been
performed with the dichotomous classification of proximal versus distal tumours.

Ginsenoside compound K, not Rb1, possesses potential chemopreventive activities
in human colorectal cancer.

Ginsenoside compound K (C-K) is an intestinal microbiota metabolite of
ginsenoside Rb1, a major constituent in American ginseng. However, previous
ginseng anti-cancer observations were largely focused on ginseng parent compounds
but not metabolites, and anti-colorectal cancer studies on C-K were limited. This
study investigated the anti-proliferative effects of C-K when compared to those
of Rb1, and the related mechanisms of action, in HCT-116 and SW-480 colorectal
cancer cells. The effects of Rb1 and C-K on the proliferation of HCT-116 and
SW-480 human colorectal cancer cells were compared using an MTS assay. Cell cycle
and cell apoptosis were assayed using flow cytometry. Enzymatic activities of
caspases were determined by colorimetric assay, and interactions of C-K and
caspases were explored by docking analysis. C-K showed significant
anti-proliferative effects in HCT-116 and SW-480 cells at concentrations of 30-50
µM. At the same concentrations, Rb1 did not show any effects, while C-K arrested 
the cells in the G1 phase, and significantly induced cell apoptosis. Compared to 
HCT-116 (p53 wild-type), the p53 mutant cell line SW-480 was more sensitive to
C-K as assessed by cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction. C-K activated
expression of caspases 8 and 9, consistent with docking analysis. The docking
data suggested that C-K forms hydrogen bonds with Lys253, Thr904 and Gly362 in
caspase 8, and with Thr62, Ser63 and Arg207 in caspase 9. C-K, but not its parent
ginsenoside Rb1, showed significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects 
in human colorectal cancer cells. These results suggest that C-K could be a
potentially effective anti-colorectal cancer agent.

Host-microbial interactions and regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier
function: From physiology to pathology.

The gastrointestinal tract is the largest reservoir of commensal bacteria in the 
human body, providing nutrients and space for the survival of microbes while
concurrently operating mucosal barriers to confine the microbial population. The 
epithelial cells linked by tight junctions not only physically separate the
microbiota from the lamina propria, but also secrete proinflammatory cytokines
and reactive oxygen species in response to pathogen invasion and metabolic stress
and serve as a sentinel to the underlying immune cells. Accumulating evidence
indicates that commensal bacteria are involved in various physiological functions
in the gut and microbial imbalances (dysbiosis) may cause pathology. Commensal
bacteria are involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell turnover,
promotion of epithelial restitution and reorganization of tight junctions, all of
which are pivotal for fortifying barrier function. Recent studies indicate that
aberrant bacterial lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling in gut mucosa may be
involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Our
perception of enteric commensals has now changed from one of opportunistic
pathogens to active participants in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. This
review attempts to explain the dynamic interaction between the intestinal
epithelium and commensal bacteria in disease and health status.

The present report summarises key insights from a recent symposium focusing on
the impact of the intestinal microbiota on health and disease. A more appropriate
definition of health was proposed since health maintenance is a dynamic process
better assessed in terms of ability to adapt to stress and maintain physiological
homeostasis. Biomarkers specifically for health are needed; use of challenge
models and subjects with suboptimal health or specific disease risk were advised.
The complexity of interactions between external factors, the intestinal
epithelium, intestinal microbiota, the immune system and health was exemplified
by describing the effects of antibiotics, the Western diet and non-digestible
carbohydrates on the microbiota. The association of certain bacteria with
different states of health or disease was acknowledged but also that is not
always clear whether this is a cause or effect. Recent identification of three
robust faecal metagenome clusters may advance this understanding. It was
speculated that knowledge of the intestinal microbiota profile may eventually
help in the diagnosis of health risks and choice of therapy. It was agreed that
beneficial manipulation of the commensal microbiota can improve health outcome.
For this purpose, three areas were reviewed. Firstly, research into probiotics as
vaccine adjuvants was considered useful for substantiation of immune function
claims. Secondly, positive results with certain probiotics and synbiotics for
colorectal cancer are emerging, mostly from in vitro and animal studies. Finally,
studies in endurance athletes have shown strain-specific probiotic benefit in
terms of maintenance of immune function and, for certain strains, reduction of
episodes of respiratory and/or gastrointestinal tract infections.

Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) strains have been suggested to be
associated with acute and persistent diarrheal disease, inflammatory bowel
disease and colorectal cancer, although further epidemiological studies are
needed for clarification. Here, a pilot study was performed to examine the effect
of the oral administration of yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain on the 
cell numbers of fecal ETBF in a healthy population. Among 420 healthy adults, 38 
subjects were found to be ETBF carriers, giving a prevalence of approximately 9%.
Among them, 32 subjects were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel-group
study to ingest yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium
longum BB536 (BB536Y group), for 8 weeks, with milk provided to the control group
(milk group). The cell numbers of ETBF and the dominant species of the B.
fragilis group were measured by a quantitative PCR method. Compared with the
baseline values, there was a significant decrease in the cell number of ETBF at
week 8 in the BB536Y group but not in the milk group. Linear mixed models
analysis for longitudinal data revealed a significant difference in the changes
of ETBF cell number between the two groups during the intervention phase. These
results imply the potential of probiotic yogurt for eliminating ETBF in the
microbiota, but its clinical significance needs to be evaluated in the future.
This is the first report of a possible effect of probiotic intake on ETBF in the 
microbiota.

The tumor microenvironment of colorectal carcinoma is a complex community of
genomically altered cancer cells, nonneoplastic cells, and a diverse collection
of microorganisms. Each of these components may contribute to carcinogenesis;
however, the role of the microbiota is the least well understood. We have
characterized the composition of the microbiota in colorectal carcinoma using
whole genome sequences from nine tumor/normal pairs. Fusobacterium sequences were
enriched in carcinomas, confirmed by quantitative PCR and 16S rDNA sequence
analysis of 95 carcinoma/normal DNA pairs, while the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
phyla were depleted in tumors. Fusobacteria were also visualized within
colorectal tumors using FISH. These findings reveal alterations in the colorectal
cancer microbiota; however, the precise role of Fusobacteria in colorectal
carcinoma pathogenesis requires further investigation.

On the relationship between sialomucin and sulfomucin expression and
hydrogenotrophic microbes in the human colonic mucosa.

The colonic mucus layer is comprised primarily of acidomucins, which provide
viscous properties and can be broadly classified into sialomucins or sulfomucins 
based on the presence of terminating sialic acid or sulfate groups. Differences
in acidomucin chemotypes have been observed in diseases such as colorectal cancer
and inflammatory bowel disease, and variation in sialo- and sulfomucin content
may influence microbial colonization. For example, sulfate derived from
sulfomucin degradation may promote the colonization of sulfate-reducing bacteria 
(SRB), which through sulfate respiration generate the genotoxic gas hydrogen
sulfide. Here, paired biopsies from right colon, left colon, and rectum of 20
subjects undergoing routine screening colonoscopies were collected to enable
parallel histochemical and microbiological studies. Goblet cell sialo- and
sulfomucins in each biopsy were distinguished histochemically and quantified.
Quantitative PCR and multivariate analyses were used to examine the abundance of 
hydrogenotrophic microbial groups and SRB genera relative to acidomucin profiles.
Regional variation was observed in sialomucins and sulfomucins with the greatest 
abundance of each found in the rectum. Mucin composition did not appear to
influence the abundance of SRB or other hydrogenotrophic microbiota but
correlated with the composition of different SRB genera. A higher sulfomucin
proportion correlated with higher quantities of Desulfobacter, Desulfobulbus and 
Desulfotomaculum, relative to the predominant Desulfovibrio genus. Thus,
acidomucin composition may influence bacterial sulfate respiration in the human
colon, which may in turn impact mucosal homeostasis. These results stress the
need to consider mucus characteristics in the context of studies of the
microbiome that target intestinal diseases.

Evidence supports involvement of microflora in the transition of chronic
inflammation to neoplasia. We investigated the protective efficacy of the
probiotic VSL#3 in a model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Chronic
colitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by administration of trinitrobenzene
sulfonic acid (TNBS), followed 6 wk later by systemic reactivation. To induce
colitis-associated dysplasia and cancer, the animals received TNBS
(intravenously) twice a week for 10 wk. One group received VSL#3 in drinking
water from 1 wk before colitis induction until death. The colons were examined
for damage and presence of dysplasia or cancer. Samples were analyzed for cell
proliferation and apoptosis, vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, angiogenic
factors, and presence of alkaline sphingomyelinase or phosphatase. Microbial
community composition was evaluated by terminal restriction fragment-length
polymorphism analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. None of the
probiotic-treated animals developed carcinoma, and no high-grade dysplasia was
found in either the proximal or mid colon. In contrast, 29% of the animals in the
control group developed carcinoma in one or more regions of the colon.
VSL#3-treated animals had significantly less damage than the vehicle
treated-controls in all areas of the colon, and this correlated with decreased
richness and diversity of the mucosally adherent microbiota. Treatment with the
probiotic increased the antiangiogenic factor angiostatin, VDR expression, and
alkaline sphingomyelinase. We concluded that pretreatment with the probiotic
VSL#3 can attenuate various inflammatory-associated parameters, delaying
transition to dysplasia and cancer, thus offering its potential therapeutic use
in patients with long-standing colitis.

healthy volunteers.

Despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer
(CRC), the composition of gut microbiota in CRC patients has not been adequately 
described. In this study, fecal bacterial diversity in CRC patients (n=46) and
healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the V3 region of
the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Both principal component analysis and UniFrac
analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. Forty-eight
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by redundancy analysis as key 
variables significantly associated with the structural difference. One OTU
closely related to Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of CRC
patients, whereas three OTUs related to Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides
uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. A total of 11 OTUs
belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella,
Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut 
microbiota of CRC patients, and 5 OTUs belonging to the genus Roseburia and other
butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae were less abundant.
Real-time quantitative PCR further validated the significant reduction of
butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of CRC patients by measuring
the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme A CoA transferase genes (Mann-Whitney test, 
P<0.01). Reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens 
may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in CRC patients.

The gut microbiota is a remarkable asset for human health. As a key element in
the development and prevention of specific diseases, its study has yielded a new 
field of promising biotherapeutics. This review provides comprehensive and
updated knowledge of the human gut microbiota, its implications in health and
disease, and the potentials and limitations of its modification by currently
available biotherapeutics to treat, prevent and/or restore human health, and
future directions. Homeostasis of the gut microbiota maintains various functions 
which are vital to the maintenance of human health. Disruption of the intestinal 
ecosystem equilibrium (gut dysbiosis) is associated with a plethora of human
diseases, including autoimmune and allergic diseases, colorectal cancer,
metabolic diseases, and bacterial infections. Relevant underlying mechanisms by
which specific intestinal bacteria populations might trigger the development of
disease in susceptible hosts are being explored across the globe. Beneficial
modulation of the gut microbiota using biotherapeutics, such as prebiotics,
probiotics, and antibiotics, may favor health-promoting populations of bacteria
and can be exploited in development of biotherapeutics. Other technologies, such 
as development of human gut models, bacterial screening, and delivery
formulations eg, microencapsulated probiotics, may contribute significantly in
the near future. Therefore, the human gut microbiota is a legitimate therapeutic 
target to treat and/or prevent various diseases. Development of a clear
understanding of the technologies needed to exploit the gut microbiota is
urgently required.

Germinated barley foodstuff contains prebiotics which are reported to have
anti-cancerous effects in colorectal cancer model, but the detailed mechanism
remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that the role of microbiota was strongly
related to the regulation of incidence and progression of colorectal cancer. The 
aim of this study was to examine the anti-neoplastic mechanism by prebiotics.
Azoxymethane treated F344 rats were used as the sporadic cancerous model. After
azoxymethane injection, either a control or germinated barley foodstuff diet was 
administered to the rats for another 5 weeks, and the number of abberant crypt
foci, toll like receptor 4, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog,
adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene and cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA
expression of colonic mucosa and cecal short chain fatty acids were examined. The
germinated barley food stuff significantly attenuated the number of abberant
crypt focis and the expression of toll like receptor 4 and cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA,
compared to the control group. In addition, the cecal butyrate production in the 
germinated barley foodstuff group was significantly higher than that in the
control. In conclusion, this prebiotic treatment for colorectal cancer may be
useful without causing the adverse effects seen in either anti-cancer drugs or
anti-inflammatory drugs.

Multiple factors drive the progression from healthy mucosa towards sporadic
colorectal carcinomas and accumulating evidence associates intestinal bacteria
with disease initiation and progression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
provide a first high-resolution map of colonic dysbiosis that is associated with 
human colorectal cancer (CRC). To this purpose, the microbiomes colonizing colon 
tumor tissue and adjacent non-malignant mucosa were compared by deep rRNA
sequencing. The results revealed striking differences in microbial colonization
patterns between these two sites. Although inter-individual colonization in CRC
patients was variable, tumors consistently formed a niche for Coriobacteria and
other proposed probiotic bacterial species, while potentially pathogenic
Enterobacteria were underrepresented in tumor tissue. As the intestinal
microbiota is generally stable during adult life, these findings suggest that
CRC-associated physiological and metabolic changes recruit tumor-foraging
commensal-like bacteria. These microbes thus have an apparent competitive
advantage in the tumor microenvironment and thereby seem to replace pathogenic
bacteria that may be implicated in CRC etiology. This first glimpse of the CRC
microbiome provides an important step towards full understanding of the dynamic
interplay between intestinal microbial ecology and sporadic CRC, which may
provide important leads towards novel microbiome-related diagnostic tools and
therapeutic interventions.

Monitoring intestinal microbiota profile: a promising method for the ultraearly
detection of colorectal cancer.

University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China.

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and is very hard to be
detected at an ultraearly stage because of lack of valuable predicating methods
that often lead to treatment failure. Intestinal microbiota has long been
considered to implicate in colorectal cancer pathology; and many recent reports
point out a close linkage between the intestinal bacteria and the genesis of the 
tumor. Present studies indicate that the structure and characteristics of the
intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in colorectal cancer,
precancerous lesion, and high risk population compared with healthy controls and 
low risk population. Based on the current studies and theories, we postulate
monitoring the intestinal bacterial profile by the molecular methods that could
fulfill the ultraearly prediction about the degree of the risk developing into
colorectal cancer. Further population-based epidemiological study is useful to
reveal the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in ultraearly colorectal 
cancer, which might provide some novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies
for the colorectal cancer.

The composition of the human intestinal microbiota is linked to health status.
The aim was to analyze the microbiota of normal and colon cancer patients in
order to establish cancer-related dysbiosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stool bacterial
DNA was extracted prior to colonoscopy from 179 patients: 60 with colorectal
cancer, and 119 with normal colonoscopy. Bacterial genes obtained by
pyrosequencing of 12 stool samples (6 Normal and 6 Cancer) were subjected to a
validated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) test. The dominant and subdominant
bacterial population (C. leptum, C. coccoides, Bacteroides/Prevotella,
Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc/Pediococcus groups, Bifidobacterium genus, and E. coli,
and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species) were quantified in all individuals
using qPCR and specific IL17 producer cells in the intestinal mucosa were
characterized using immunohistochemistry.
FINDINGS: Pyrosequencing (Minimal sequence 200 nucleotide reads) revealed 80% of 
all sequences could be assigned to a total of 819 taxa based on default parameter
of Classifier software. The phylogenetic core in Cancer individuals was different
from that in Normal individuals according to the PCA analysis, with trends
towards differences in the dominant and subdominant families of bacteria.
Consequently, All-bacteria [log(10) (bacteria/g of stool)] in Normal, and Cancer 
individuals were similar [11.88±0.35, and 11.80±0.56, respectively, (P = 0.16)], 
according to qPCR values whereas among all dominant and subdominant species only 
those of Bacteroides/Prevotella were higher (All bacteria-specific bacterium;
P = 0.009) in Cancer (-1.04±0.55) than in Normal (-1.40±0.83) individuals. IL17
immunoreactive cells were significantly expressed more in the normal mucosa of
cancer patients than in those with normal colonoscopy.
CONCLUSION: This is the first large series to demonstrate a composition change in
the microbiota of colon cancer patients with possible impact on mucosal immune
response. These data open new filed for mass screening and pathophysiology
investigations.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary fibre lowers the risk of
colorectal cancer, which may be due to increased butyrate production from colonic
fermentation of a type of fibre, resistant starch (RS). The present study
investigated the effects of dietary RS and butyrylated RS on the faecal
microbiota of rats treated with azoxymethane. A total of four groups of nine rats
were fed diets containing either standard maize starch (low-amylose maize starch 
(LAMS), low RS), LAMS with 3 % tributyrin (LAMST), cooked 10 % high-amylose maize
starch (HAMS, high RS) or cooked 10 % butyrylated HAMS (HAMSB). Faecal samples
were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 
16S rRNA gene fragments. Multivariate analysis demonstrated no differences
between faecal microbiota before treatment but revealed differences in DGGE
patterns between diet groups, with the exception of the two low-RS groups (LAMS
and LAMST). Subsequent analysis identified eleven DGGE bands contributing
significantly to the differentiation between diets. These phylotypes belonged to 
Clostridiales (five), Lactobacillus (one) and Bacteroidetes (five) lineages. Rats
fed HAMS had increased concentration of propionate in their distal colonic
digesta and developed faecal populations containing Ruminococcus bromii-like
bacteria. HAMSB increased propionate and butyrate concentrations in distal
colonic digesta and was associated with the appearance of two
non-butyrate-producing bacteria, Lactobacillus gasseri and Parabacteroides
distasonis. In conclusion, supplementation with specific dietary RS leads to
changes in faecal microbiota profiles that may be associated with improved bowel 
health.

BACKGROUND: Infection following abdominal operation remains a major factor
affecting the morbidity of patients after surgery.
AIM: To determine the effects of perioperative administration of probiotics on
the gut barrier function and the surgical outcome in patients undergoing elective
colorectal surgery.
METHODS: One hundred patients with colorectal carcinoma were randomly divided
into the control group (n = 50) and the probiotics group (n = 50). The probiotics
were given orally for 6 days preoperatively and 10 days post-operatively.
Outcomes were measured by bacterial translocation, gut permeability, the effect
on the faecal microbiota, and the clinical outcomes such as infectious-related
complications and gut defecation function.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, probiotics group had increased
transepithelial resistance (P < 0.05), reduced transmucosal permeation of
horseradish peroxidase and lactulose/mannitol ratio, reduced bacterial
translocation (P < 0.05), decreased ileal-bile acid binding protein (P < 0.05)
and positive rate of blood bacterial DNA (P < 0.05) and an enhanced mucosal tight
junction protein expression. They had decreased blood enteropathogenic bacteria
and increased faecal bacterial variety. The post-operative recovery of
peristalsis, incidence of diarrhoea, and infectious-related complications were
also improved.
CONCLUSION: Probiotics can improve the integrity of gut mucosal barrier by
benefiting the faecal microbiota, and decreasing infectious complications in
patients with colorectal cancer undergoing colorectomy.

The human large bowel is colonized by complex and diverse bacterial communities. 
However, the relationship between commensal bowel bacteria and adenomas
(colorectal cancer precursors) is unclear. This study aimed to characterize
adherent bacteria in normal colon and evaluate differences in community
composition associated with colorectal adenomas. We evaluated adherent bacteria
in normal colonic mucosa of 21 adenoma and 23 non-adenoma subjects enrolled in a 
cross sectional study. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, clone
sequencing and fluorescent in-situ hybridization analysis of the 16S rRNA genes
were used to characterize adherent bacteria. A total of 335 clones were sequenced
and processed for phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis. Differences in bacterial
composition between cases and controls were evaluated by UniFrac and analysis of 
similarity matrix. Overall, Firmicutes (62%), Bacteroidetes (26%) and
Proteobacteria (11%) were the most dominant phyla. The bacterial composition
differed significantly between cases and controls (UniFrac p < 0.001). We
observed significantly higher abundance of Proteobacteria (p < 0.05) and lower
abundance of Bacteroidetes (p < 0.05) in cases compared to controls. At the genus
level, case subjects showed increased abundance of Dorea spp. (p < 0.005),
Faecalibacterium spp. (p < 0.05) and lower proportions of Bacteroides spp. (p <
0.03) and Coprococcus spp. (p < 0.05) than controls. Cases had higher bacterial
diversity and richness than controls. These findings reveal that alterations in
bacterial community composition associated with adenomas may contribute to the
etiology of colorectal cancer. Extension of these findings could lead to
strategies to manipulate the microbiota to prevent colorectal adenomas and cancer
as well as to identify individuals at high risk.

AIM: To investigate whether probiotic bacteria, given perioperatively, might
adhere to the colonic mucosa, reduce concentration of pathogens in stools, and
modulate the local immune function.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was carried out in 31 subjects
undergoing elective colorectal resection for cancer. Patients were allocated to
receive either a placebo (group A, n = 10), or a dose of 10(7) of a mixture of
Bifidobacterium longum (BB536) and Lactobacillus johnsonii (La1) (group B, n =
11), or the same mixture at a concentration of 10(9) (group C, n = 10).
Probiotics, or a placebo, were given orally 2 doses/d for 3 d before operation.
The same treatment continued postoperatively from day two to day four. Stools
were collected before treatment, during surgery (day 0) and 5 d after operation. 
During the operation, colonic mucosa samples were harvested to evaluate bacterial
adherence and to assess the phenotype of dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocyte
subsets by surface antigen expression (flow cytometry). The presence of BB536 and
La1 was evaluated by the random amplified polymorphism DNA method with specific
polymerase chain reaction probes.
RESULTS: The three groups were balanced for baseline and surgical parameters.
BB536 was never found at any time-points studied. At day 0, La1 was present in
6/10 (60%) patients in either stools or by biopsy in group C, in 3/11 (27.2%) in 
group B, and none in the placebo group (P = 0.02, C vs A). There was a linear
correlation between dose given and number of adherent La1 (P = 0.01). The rate of
mucosal colonization by enterobacteriacae was 30% (3/10) in C, 81.8% (9/11) in B 
and 70% (7/10) in A (P = 0.03, C vs B). The Enterobacteriacae count in stools was
2.4 (log10 scale) in C, 4.6 in B, and 4.5 in A (P = 0.07, C vs A and B). The same
trend was observed for colonizing enterococci. La1 was not found at day +5. We
observed greater expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, and naive and memory lymphocyte
subsets in group C than in group A with a dose response trend (C > B > A).
Treatment did not affect DC phenotype or activation, but after ex vivo
stimulation with lipopolysaccharides, groups C and B had a lower proliferation
rate compared to group A (P = 0.04). Moreover, dendritic phenotypes CD83-123,
CD83-HLADR, and CD83-11c (markers of activation) were significantly less
expressed in patients colonized with La1 (P = 0.03 vs not colonized).
CONCLUSION: La1, but not BB536, adheres to the colonic mucosa, and affects
intestinal microbiota by reducing the concentration of pathogens and modulates
local immunity.

Associations between dietary habits and body mass index with gut microbiota
composition and fecal water genotoxicity: an observational study in African
American and Caucasian American volunteers.

Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. vmai@ufl.edu

BACKGROUND: African Americans (AA) suffer from an increased incidence and
mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). Environmental exposures including dietary
habits likely contribute to a high burden of CRC, however, data on the dietary
habits of AA is sparse. Diet might change the composition and the activities of
the intestinal microbiota, in turn affecting fecal genotoxicity/mutagenicity that
is thought to be associated with carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We assessed dietary habits by food frequency questionnaire and by food
records in 52 AA and 46 CA residents of the Eastern Shore of MD. Fecal microbiota
composition was determined using 16S rRNA based methods and fecal genotoxicity
measured using the Comet assay.
RESULTS: AA reported an increased intake of heterocyclic amines and a decreased
dietary intake of vitamins including vitamin D (p<0.05) that correlated with
differences in fecal microbiota composition but not fecal genotoxicity. Intake of
dietary fiber, calcium, total fat and heterocyclic amines correlated with
differences in microbiota composition. Total bacterial counts/g of stool and raw 
counts of Bacteroides were increased in AA. In contrast to a previous study, BMI 
was not associated with proportions of Bacteroides.
CONCLUSION: Dietary habits of African Americans, including increased HCA intake
and decreased vitamin D intake might at least partially contribute to CRC through
modifications of gut microbiota composition that result in changes of the
intestinal milieu.

It is well established that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role in the
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) collectively
referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Epidemiological studies have
provided strong evidence that IBD patients bear increased risk for the
development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the impact of the microbiota on 
the development of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) remains largely unknown. In
this study, we established a new model of CAC using azoxymethane (AOM)-exposed,
conventionalized-Il10(-/-) mice and have explored the contribution of the host
intestinal microbiota and MyD88 signaling to the development of CAC. We show that
8/13 (62%) of AOM-Il10(-/-) mice developed colon tumors compared to only 3/15
(20%) of AOM- wild-type (WT) mice. Conventionalized AOM-Il10(-/-) mice developed 
spontaneous colitis and colorectal carcinomas while AOM-WT mice were colitis-free
and developed only rare adenomas. Importantly, tumor multiplicity directly
correlated with the presence of colitis. Il10(-/-) mice mono-associated with the 
mildly colitogenic bacterium Bacteroides vulgatus displayed significantly reduced
colitis and colorectal tumor multiplicity compared to Il10(-/-) mice. Germ-free
AOM-treated Il10(-/-) mice showed normal colon histology and were devoid of
tumors. Il10(-/-); Myd88(-/-) mice treated with AOM displayed reduced expression 
of Il12p40 and Tnfalpha mRNA and showed no signs of tumor development. We present
the first direct demonstration that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota
alters the development of CAC. The TLR/MyD88 pathway is essential for
microbiota-induced development of CAC. Unlike findings obtained using the AOM/DSS
model, we demonstrate that the severity of chronic colitis directly correlates to
colorectal tumor development and that bacterial-induced inflammation drives
progression from adenoma to invasive carcinoma.

The normal microbiota and man form a superorganism, in which only 10% are human
cells. The skin and mucous membranes support 10(14) living microbes, mainly at
the end of the gastrointestinal tract, forming a 1.5-kg cell mass ecosystem
mainly consisting of bacteria. Investigations of the intestinal microbiota have
yielded an estimated biodiversity of 1200-16000 bacterial phylotypes. They are
known to affect physiology, development of immune defense, colonization
resistance and nutrition. Changes in microbial population can be associated with 
inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, obesity
and type 2 diabetes.

Intestinal microbiota are considered to play an important role both in colorectal
tumor development and in the modulation of mucosal immunity. Studies on animals
reared in germ-free (GF, without intestinal microbiota) versus conventional (CV, 
with regular microbiota colonization of the bowel) conditions can aid in
clarifying the influence of bacteria on carcinogenesis and the anticancer immune 
response. The capability of the intestinal environment to modulate anticancer
immunity not only at the mucosal but also at the systemic level is still an open 
question. In our study we found that, following the same protocol of colorectal
cancer induction, GF rats developed less and smaller tumors than CV rats. The GF 
rats that did not develop cancer also presented a better anticancer immune
response with an increase in NK, NKT, CTL, B cells and cytotoxicity in peripheral
blood. We hypothesize that the lower antigenic challenge and the absence of the
'physiological inflammation', caused by the commensal microbiota in the gut of CV
rats, may enhance the capability of the GF rats to develop more efficacious
anticancer immune responses. The different levels of tolerance/regulatory
mechanisms in GF versus the CV animals may modulate the anticancer response not
only at the mucosal but also at the systemic immunity level.

A role for the intestinal microbiota is routinely cited as a potential
aetiological factor in colorectal cancer initiation and progression. As the
majority of bacteria in the gut are refractory to culture we investigated this
ecosystem in subjects with colorectal cancer and with adenomatous polyposis who
are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer, using culture-independent
methods. Twenty colorectal cancer and 20 polypectomized volunteers were chosen
for this analysis. An exploration of the diversity and temporal stability of the 
dominant bacteria and several bacterial subgroups was undertaken using 16S rRNA
gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and ribosomal intergenic spacer
analysis (RISA). Metabonomic analysis of the distal gut microbiota's environment 
was also undertaken. A significantly reduced temporal stability and increased
diversity for the microbiota of subjects with colorectal cancer and polyposis was
evident. A significantly increased diversity of the Clostridium leptum and C.
coccoides subgroups was also noted for both disease groups. A clear division in
the metabonome was observed for the colorectal cancer and polypectomized subjects
compared with control volunteers. The intestinal microbiota and their metabolites
are significantly altered in both colorectal cancer and polypectomized subjects
compared with controls.

AIM: To characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in
patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis.
METHODS: A sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a
total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with
diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for
their condition. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the resected mucosal samples
and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and
quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Bifidobacteria were found in 100% of the samples from patients with
diverticulitis or IBD and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. The species B.
longum and B. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by B. animalis, B.
catenulatum and B. adolescentis. B. breve, B. dentium and B. angulatum were not
detected in any sample. A significantly higher occurrence of B. longum was
observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or IBD
(100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained for B.
animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, P < 0.05), while B. adolescentis was only found in the
mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). At the quantitative
level, patients with colon cancer or IBD showed lower counts of total
Bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, P < 0.05) 
and of the species B. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, P < 0.05) than those with
diverticulitis.
CONCLUSION: Aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different 
intestinal diseases. This may indicate a role of the microbiota in the
pathogenesis of these diseases.

Evidence that hydrogen sulfide is a genotoxic agent.

Attene-Ramos MS(1), Wagner ED, Plewa MJ, Gaskins HR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Animal Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by commensal sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are
often members of normal colonic microbiota, represents an environmental insult to
the intestinal epithelium potentially contributing to chronic intestinal
disorders that are dependent on gene-environment interactions. For example,
epidemiologic studies reveal either persistent sulfate-reducing bacteria
colonization or H2S in the gut or feces of patients suffering from ulcerative
colitis and colorectal cancer. However, a mechanistic model that explains the
connection between H2S and ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer development
has not been completely formulated. In this study, we examined the chronic
cytotoxicity of sulfide using a microplate assay and genotoxicity using the
single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE; comet assay) in Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) and HT29-Cl.16E cells. Sulfide showed chronic cytotoxicity in CHO cells
with a %C1/2 of 368.57 micromol/L. Sulfide was not genotoxic in the standard SCGE
assay. However, in a modified SCGE assay in which DNA repair was inhibited, a
marked genotoxic effect was observed. A sulfide concentration as low as 250
micromol/L (similar to that found in human colon) caused significant genomic DNA 
damage. The HT29-Cl.16E colonocyte cell line also exhibited increased genomic DNA
damage as a function of Na2S concentration when DNA repair was inhibited,
although these cells were less sensitive to sulfide than CHO cells. These data
indicate that given a predisposing genetic background that compromises DNA
repair, H2S may lead to genomic instability or the cumulative mutations found in 
adenomatous polyps leading to colorectal cancer.

Changes in cecal microbial metabolism of rats induced by individual and a mixture
of drinking water disinfection by-products.

George SE(1), Wolf DC, Brooks LR, Bailey KC, Hooth MJ, Nelson GM.

(1)Department of Energy, Washington, DC, USA.

Disinfection of drinking water has been one of the greatest public health
successes. Numerous halogenated disinfection by-products (DBPs) occur and chronic
ingestion has been associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer in
human populations. Because the intestinal microbiota can bioactivate xenobiotics,
studies have been performed to examine the effects of individual DBPs on
intestinal microbial metabolism. No studies have been conducted on a defined
mixture of DBPs to determine if there is an enhancement of response to a mixture.
Ten-week-old male Long-Evans rats were treated in their drinking water for 17
weeks with 0.4 g/l potassium bromate, 1.8 g/l chloroform, 0.7 g/l
bromodichloromethane (BDCM), 0.07 g/l
3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX), or a mixture of the
four chemicals or distilled water. Cecal nitroreductase (NR), azoreductase (AR), 
dechlorinase (DC), beta-glucuronidase (GLR), beta-galactosidase (GAL), and
beta-glucosidase (GLU) were assayed. No change in GLU or GLR activity was
detected after treatment. BDCM treatment reduced DC and GAL activities and
elevated NR and AR activity. GAL, AR, and NR activities were significantly
different after treatment with bromate, chloroform, BDCM, and MX, but not the
mixture. DC activity after chloroform-, MX-, or BDCM-treatment was significantly 
below control levels. The present study shows that changes in intestinal
microbial metabolism do occur after treatment with individual and a mixture of
DBPs but the changes were not additive in the mixture group.

CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T lymphocytes inhibit microbially induced colon cancer in
Rag2-deficient mice.

Inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
increase the risk of colorectal cancer in humans. It has been recently shown in
humans and animal models that intestinal microbiota and host immunity are
integral in the progression of large bowel diseases. Lymphocytes are widely
believed to prevent bacterially induced inflammation in the bowel, and
lymphocytes are also critical in protecting against primary tumors of intestinal 
epithelia in mice. Taken together, this raises the possibility that lymphocytes
may inhibit colon carcinogenesis by reducing bacterially driven inflammation. To 
examine the role of bacteria, lymphocytes, and inflammatory bowel disease in the 
development of colon cancer, 129/SvEv Rag-2-deficient and congenic wild-type mice
were orally inoculated with a widespread enteric mouse bacterial pathogen,
Helicobacter hepaticus, or sham-dosed with media only. H. hepaticus-infected
Rag2-/-, but not sham-dosed Rag2-/- mice, rapidly developed colitis and large
bowel carcinoma. This demonstrated a link between microbially driven inflammation
and cancer in the lower bowel and suggested that innate immune dysregulation may 
have an important role in inflammatory bowel disease and progression to cancer.
H. hepaticus-infected wild-type mice did not develop inflammation or carcinoma
showing that lymphocytes were required to prevent bacterially induced cancer at
this site. Adoptive transfer with CD4+ CD45RBlo CD25+ regulatory T cells into
Rag-deficient hosts significantly inhibited H. hepaticus-induced inflammation and
development of cancer. These results suggested that the ability of CD4+ T cells
to protect against intestinal cancer was correlated with their ability to reduce 
bacterially induced inflammatory bowel disease. Further, regulatory T cells may
act directly on the innate immune system to reduce or prevent disease. These
