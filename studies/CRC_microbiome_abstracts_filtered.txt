In this study Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze and compare
human microbiota from three different compartments, i.e., saliva, feces, and
cancer tissue (CT), of a selected cohort of 10 Italian patients with colorectal
cancer (CRC) vs. 10 healthy controls (saliva and feces). Furthermore, the
Fusobacterium nucleatum abundance in the same body site was investigated through 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to assess the association
with CRC. Differences in bacterial composition, F. nucleatum abundance in healthy
controls vs. CRC patients, and the association of F. nucleatum with clinical
parameters were observed. Taxonomic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene, revealed the
presence of three main bacterial phyla, which includes about 80% of reads:
Firmicutes (39.18%), Bacteroidetes (30.36%), and Proteobacteria (10.65%). The
results highlighted the presence of different bacterial compositions; in
particular, the fecal samples of CRC patients seemed to be enriched with
Bacteroidetes, whereas in the fecal samples of healthy controls Firmicutes were
one of the major phyla detected though these differences were not statistically
significant. The CT samples showed the highest alpha diversity values. These
results emphasize a different taxonomic composition of feces from CRC compared to
healthy controls. Despite the low number of samples included in the study, these 
results suggest the importance of microbiota in the CRC progression and could
pave the way to the development of therapeutic interventions and novel
microbial-related diagnostic tools in CRC patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common cancer worldwide, with a
growing incidence among young adults. Multiple studies have presented
associations between the gut microbiome and CRC, suggesting a link with cancer
risk. Although CRC microbiome studies continue to profile larger patient cohorts 
with increasingly economical and rapid DNA sequencing platforms, few common
associations with CRC have been identified, in part due to limitations in
taxonomic resolution and differences in analysis methodologies. Complementing
these taxonomic studies is the newly recognized phenomenon that bacterial
organization into biofilm structures in the mucus layer of the gut is a
consistent feature of right-sided (proximal), but not left-sided (distal)
colorectal cancer. In the present study, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon
sequencing and biofilm quantification in a new cohort of patients from Malaysia, 
followed by a meta-analysis of eleven additional publicly available data sets on 
stool and tissue-based CRC microbiota using Resphera Insight, a high-resolution
analytical tool for species-level characterization. Results from the Malaysian
cohort and the expanded meta-analysis confirm that CRC tissues are enriched for
invasive biofilms (particularly on right-sided tumors), a symbiont with capacity 
for tumorigenesis (Bacteroides fragilis), and oral pathogens including
Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Peptostreptococcus stomatis.
Considered in aggregate, species from the Human Oral Microbiome Database are
highly enriched in CRC. Although no detected microbial feature was universally
present, their substantial overlap and combined prevalence supports a role for
the gut microbiota in a significant percentage (>80%) of CRC cases.

Colorectal cancers comprise a complex mixture of malignant cells, nontransformed 
cells, and microorganisms. Fusobacterium nucleatum is among the most prevalent
bacterial species in colorectal cancer tissues. Here we show that colonization of
human colorectal cancers with Fusobacterium and its associated
microbiome-including Bacteroides, Selenomonas, and Prevotella species-is
maintained in distal metastases, demonstrating microbiome stability between
paired primary and metastatic tumors. In situ hybridization analysis revealed
that Fusobacterium is predominantly associated with cancer cells in the
metastatic lesions. Mouse xenografts of human primary colorectal adenocarcinomas 
were found to retain viable Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome through
successive passages. Treatment of mice bearing a colon cancer xenograft with the 
antibiotic metronidazole reduced Fusobacterium load, cancer cell proliferation,
and overall tumor growth. These observations argue for further investigation of
antimicrobial interventions as a potential treatment for patients with
Fusobacterium-associated colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a worldwide health problem. Despite growing
evidence that members of the gut microbiota can drive tumorigenesis, little is
known about what happens to it after treatment for an adenoma or carcinoma. This 
study tested the hypothesis that treatment for adenoma or carcinoma alters the
abundance of bacterial populations associated with disease to those associated
with a normal colon. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes
in the feces of 67 individuals before and after treatment for adenoma (N = 22),
advanced adenoma (N = 19), and carcinoma (N = 26).
RESULTS: There were small changes to the bacterial community associated with
adenoma or advanced adenoma and large changes associated with carcinoma. The
communities from patients with carcinomas changed significantly more than those
with adenoma following treatment (P value < 0.001). Although treatment was
associated with intrapersonal changes, the change in the abundance of individual 
OTUs in response to treatment was not consistent within diagnosis groups (P value
> 0.05). Because the distribution of OTUs across patients and diagnosis groups
was irregular, we used the random forest machine learning algorithm to identify
groups of OTUs that could be used to classify pre and post-treatment samples for 
each of the diagnosis groups. Although the adenoma and carcinoma models could
reliably differentiate between the pre- and post-treatment samples (P value <
0.001), the advanced-adenoma model could not (P value = 0.61). Furthermore, there
was little overlap between the OTUs that were indicative of each treatment. To
determine whether individuals who underwent treatment were more likely to have
OTUs associated with normal colons we used a larger cohort that contained
individuals with normal colons and those with adenomas, advanced adenomas, and
carcinomas. We again built random forest models and measured the change in the
positive probability of having one of the three diagnoses to assess whether the
post-treatment samples received the same classification as the pre-treatment
samples. Samples from patients who had carcinomas changed toward a microbial
milieu that resembles the normal colon after treatment (P value < 0.001).
Finally, we were unable to detect any significant differences in the microbiota
of individuals treated with surgery alone and those treated with chemotherapy or 
chemotherapy and radiation (P value > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: By better understanding the response of the microbiota to treatment 
for adenomas and carcinomas, it is likely that biomarkers will eventually be
validated that can be used to quantify the risk of recurrence and the likelihood 
of survival. Although it was difficult to identify significant differences
between pre- and post-treatment samples from patients with adenoma and advanced
adenoma, this was not the case for carcinomas. Not only were there large changes 
in pre- versus post-treatment samples for those with carcinoma, but also these
changes were toward a more normal microbiota.

Increasing evidence suggests a role of the gut microbiota in colorectal
carcinogenesis (CRC). To detect bacterial markers of colorectal cancer in African
Americans a metabolomic analysis was performed on fecal water extracts. DNA from 
stool samples of adenoma and healthy subjects and from colon cancer and matched
normal tissues was analyzed to determine the microbiota composition (using 16S
rDNA) and genomic content (metagenomics). Metagenomic functions with
discriminative power between healthy and neoplastic specimens were established.
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (q-PCR) using primers and probes specific 
to Streptococcus sp. VT_162 were used to validate this bacterium association with
neoplastic transformation in stool samples from two independent cohorts of
African Americans and Chinese patients with colorectal lesions. The metabolomic
analysis of adenomas revealed low amino acids content. The microbiota in both
cancer vs. normal tissues and adenoma vs. normal stool samples were different at 
the 16S rRNA gene level. Cross-mapping of metagenomic data led to 9 markers with 
significant discriminative power between normal and diseased specimens. These
markers identified with Streptococcus sp. VT_162. Q-PCR data showed a
statistically significant presence of this bacterium in advanced adenoma and
cancer samples in an independent cohort of CRC patients. We defined metagenomic
functions from Streptococcus sp. VT_162 with discriminative power among cancers
vs. matched normal and adenomas vs. healthy subjects' stools. Streptococcus sp.
VT_162 specific 16S rDNA was validated in an independent cohort. These findings
might facilitate non-invasive screening for colorectal cancer.

It is well appreciated that microbial metabolism of drugs can influence treatment
efficacy. Microbial β-glucuronidases in the gut can reactivate the excreted,
inactive metabolite of irinotecan, a first-line chemotherapeutic for metastatic
colorectal cancer. Reactivation causes adverse drug responses, including severe
diarrhea. However, a direct connection between irinotecan metabolism and the
composition of an individual's gut microbiota has not previously been made. Here,
we report quantitative evidence of inter-individual variability in microbiome
metabolism of the inactive metabolite of irinotecan to its active form. We
identify a high turnover microbiota metabotype with potentially elevated risk for
irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses. We link the high turnover metabotype
to unreported microbial β-glucuronidases; inhibiting these enzymes may decrease
irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses in targeted subsets of patients. In
total, this study reveals metagenomic mining of the microbiome, combined with
metabolomics, as a non-invasive approach to develop biomarkers for colorectal
cancer treatment outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Microbiota alterations are linked with colorectal cancer
(CRC) and notably higher abundance of putative oral bacteria on colonic tumours. 
However, it is not known if colonic mucosa-associated taxa are indeed orally
derived, if such cases are a distinct subset of patients or if the oral
microbiome is generally suitable for screening for CRC.
METHODS: We profiled the microbiota in oral swabs, colonic mucosae and stool from
individuals with CRC (99 subjects), colorectal polyps (32) or controls (103).
RESULTS: Several oral taxa were differentially abundant in CRC compared with
controls, for example, Streptococcus and Prevotellas pp. A classification model
of oral swab microbiota distinguished individuals with CRC or polyps from
controls (sensitivity: 53% (CRC)/67% (polyps); specificity: 96%). Combining the
data from faecal microbiota and oral swab microbiota increased the sensitivity of
this model to 76% (CRC)/88% (polyps). We detected similar bacterial networks in
colonic microbiota and oral microbiota datasets comprising putative oral biofilm 
forming bacteria. While these taxa were more abundant in CRC, core networks
between pathogenic, CRC-associated oral bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus,
Parvimonas and Fusobacterium were also detected in healthy controls. High
abundance of Lachnospiraceae was negatively associated with the colonisation of
colonic tissue with oral-like bacterial networks suggesting a protective role for
certain microbiota types against CRC, possibly by conferring colonisation
resistance to CRC-associated oral taxa and possibly mediated through habitual
diet.
CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of CRC may relate to microbiota types that either
predispose or provide resistance to the disease, and profiling the oral
microbiome may offer an alternative screen for detecting CRC.

OBJECTIVE: The colonic microbiota is altered in patients with colorectal cancer
(CRC). We investigated the microbiota composition of patients with colon cancer
compared with controls devoid of neoplastic or inflammatory disease and the
potential to modify the colonic microbiota with probiotics.
DESIGN: Biopsy samples were obtained from the normal mucosa and tumour during
colonoscopy from 15 patients with colon cancer. Subsequent patient-matched
samples were taken at surgery from the tumour and nearby mucosa from the patients
with cancer, eight of whom had received two daily tablets totalling 1.4×1010 CFUs
Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 and 7×109 CFUs Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
Faecal samples were obtained after colonoscopy prior to starting the intervention
and at surgery. In addition, 21 mucosal biopsies from non-cancer controls were
obtained during colonoscopy followed by later faecal samples. The colonic and
faecal microbiota was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
RESULTS: The tumour microbiota was characterised by increased microbial diversity
and enrichment of several taxa including Fusobacterium, Selenomonas and
Peptostreptococcus compared with the control microbiota. Patients with colon
cancer that received probiotics had an increased abundance of butyrate-producing 
bacteria, especially Faecalibacterium and Clostridiales spp in the tumour,
non-tumour mucosa and faecal microbiota. CRC-associated genera such as
Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus tended to be reduced in the faecal
microbiota of patients that received probiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with colon cancer harbour a distinct microbiota signature
in the tumour tissue and nearby mucosa, which was altered with probiotic
intervention. Our results show promise for potential therapeutic benefits in CRC 
by manipulation of the microbiota.

Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD). In colorectal cancer, the gut microbiota has also been recognized as
potentially involved in aggravating or favoring the tumor development. However,
very little is known on the structure and role of the microbiota in colitis
associated cancer (CAC), an important complication of IBD in human. Here we
analyzed the bacterial and fungal composition of the mucosa associated microbiota
of patients suffering CAC, sporadic cancer (SC) and of healthy subjects (HS) by
barcode sequences analysis on the following cohort: 7 CAC patients, 10 SC
patients and 10 HS using 16S (MiSeq) and ITS2 (pyrosequencing) sequencing, for
bacteria and fungi respectively. Mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in CAC
was significantly different from the ones in SC or in HS, while the fungal showed
no differences. Comparison between mucosa-associated microbiota on the tumor site
or in normal mucosa near the tumor showed very similar patterns. The global
mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in cancer patients was characterized by a 
restriction in biodiversity but no change for the fungal community. Compared to
SC, CAC was characterized by an increase of Enterobacteriacae family and
Sphingomonas genus and a decrease of Fusobacterium and Ruminococcus genus. Our
study confirms the alteration of the mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota in
IBD and SC. Although the cohort is limited in number, this is the first evidence 
of the existence of an altered bacterial microbiota in CAC clearly different from
the one in SC patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease and recent advances in subtype
classification have successfully stratified the disease using molecular
profiling. The contribution of bacterial species to CRC development is
increasingly acknowledged, and here, we sought to analyse CRC microbiomes and
relate them to tumour consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), in order to better
understand the relationship between bacterial species and the molecular
mechanisms associated with CRC subtypes. We classified 34 tumours into CRC
subtypes using RNA-sequencing derived gene expression and determined relative
abundances of bacterial taxonomic groups using 16S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding.
16S rRNA analysis showed enrichment of Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and
decreased levels of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in CMS1. A more detailed
analysis of bacterial taxa using non-human RNA-sequencing reads uncovered
distinct bacterial communities associated with each molecular subtype. The most
highly enriched species associated with CMS1 included Fusobacterium hwasookii and
Porphyromonas gingivalis. CMS2 was enriched for Selenomas and Prevotella species,
while CMS3 had few significant associations. Targeted quantitative PCR validated 
these findings and also showed an enrichment of Fusobacterium nucleatum,
Parvimonas micra and Peptostreptococcus stomatis in CMS1. In this study, we have 
successfully associated individual bacterial species to CRC subtypes for the
first time.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the microbiota community
structure, assess differences in intestinal bacterial types, and identify
metagenomic biomarkers for disparate stages of colorectal cancer formation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 160 individuals were recruited: 61 cases with
non-tumor colon were regarded as the normal group, 47 cases with
histology-substantiated colorectal adenomas were regarded as the adenoma group,
and 52 cases with invasive adenocarcinomas were regarded as the cancer group.
Biopsy on the mucosa was performed on each subject. USEARCH was used to process
the sequences data and generate OTUs. Gut mucosal microbiota from healthy
controls, adenoma patients, and carcinoma patients were analyzed. RESULTS
Principal coordinate analysis of unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance showed 
a separation in composition of microbiota in the 3 groups. Bacteria with
potential tumorigenesis, like Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium, were more
common in the carcinoma group, while some SCFA (short chain fatty
acids) - producing microbes were enriched in the normal group. The commensal
Escherichia were more abundant in adenoma patients. CONCLUSIONS Our study
provides insights into possible function of gut microbiota in diagnosis and
treatment of colorectal cancer. Some bacteria, such as Butyricicoccus, E. coli,
and Fusobacterium, can be used as potential biomarkers for normal, adenoma, and
cancer groups, respectively.

Colon cancer induces a state of mucosal dysbiosis with associated niche specific 
changes in the gut microbiota. However, the key metabolic functions of these
bacteria remain unclear. We performed a prospective observational study in
patients undergoing elective surgery for colon cancer without mechanical bowel
preparation (n = 18). Using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing we demonstrated that
microbiota ecology appears to be cancer stage-specific and strongly associated
with histological features of poor prognosis. Fusobacteria (p < 0.007) and ε-
Proteobacteria (p < 0.01) were enriched on tumour when compared to adjacent
normal mucosal tissue, and fusobacteria and β-Proteobacteria levels increased
with advancing cancer stage (p = 0.014 and 0.002 respecitvely). Metabonomic
analysis using 1H Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonsance  (MAS-NMR)
spectroscopy, demonstrated increased abundance of taurine, isoglutamine, choline,
lactate, phenylalanine and tyrosine and decreased levels of lipids and
triglycerides in tumour relative to adjacent healthy tissue. Network analysis
revealed that bacteria associated with poor prognostic features were not
responsible for the modification of the cancer mucosal metabonome. Thus the colon
cancer mucosal microbiome evolves with cancer stage to meet the demands of cancer
metabolism. Passenger microbiota may play a role in the maintenance of cancer
mucosal metabolic homeostasis but these metabolic functions may not be stage
specific.

Gut microbiota are linked to chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis.
Chemotherapy failure is the major cause of recurrence and poor prognosis in
colorectal cancer patients. Here, we investigated the contribution of gut
microbiota to chemoresistance in patients with colorectal cancer. We found that
Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum was abundant in colorectal cancer tissues in
patients with recurrence post chemotherapy, and was associated with patient
clinicopathological characterisitcs. Furthermore, our bioinformatic and
functional studies demonstrated that F. nucleatum promoted colorectal cancer
resistance to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum targeted TLR4 and MYD88
innate immune signaling and specific microRNAs to activate the autophagy pathway 
and alter colorectal cancer chemotherapeutic response. Thus, F. nucleatum
orchestrates a molecular network of the Toll-like receptor, microRNAs, and
autophagy to clinically, biologically, and mechanistically control colorectal
cancer chemoresistance. Measuring and targeting F. nucleatum and its associated
pathway will yield valuable insight into clinical management and may ameliorate
colorectal cancer patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Studies on gut microbiota regarding colorectal carcinogenesis,
including sessile serrated adenoma (SSA), have been scarce. The aim of this study
is to investigate the role of mucosa-associated gut microbiota in the colorectal 
carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We collected biopsy samples of normal rectal mucosa during colonoscopy
from healthy control and patients with conventional adenoma, SSA, and colorectal 
cancer (CRC), respectively (n = 6). Pyrosequencing for 16S rRNA gene of bacteria 
was performed to compare gut microbiota.
RESULTS: The most abundant phylum in total samples was Proteobacteria (55.6%),
followed by Firmicutes (27.4%) and Bacteroidetes (11.6%). There was no
significant difference in relative abundance of the phylum level among the four
groups. Fusobacterium nucleatum, known to be frequently detected during
colorectal carcinogenesis, was found in only one sample of patient with SSA. The 
rarefaction curves showed that the diversity of mucosal communities of patients
with CRC is the lowest among the four groups and the diversity of mucosal
communities of patients with SSA is higher than that of healthy control. Among
the four groups, Shannon's and Simpson's index for diversity was the lowest and
the highest in the patients with CRC, respectively; it did not reach statistical 
significance. The proportion of genus Pseudomonas was very high in the samples of
patients with stage II-IV CRC compared with those with stage I CRC (59.3% vs.
0.3%, P = 0.064).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests no significant role of mucosa-associated gut
microbiota in the colorectal carcinogenesis. Further study for many samples or
using fecal material could be helpful.

The aim of this study was to explore the gut microbiota profiles of colorectal
cancer (CRC) patients and to examine the relationship between gut microbiota and 
other key molecular factors involved in CRC tumorigenesis. In this study, a 16S
rDNA sequencing platform was used to identify possible differences in the
microbiota signature between CRC and adjacent normal mucosal tissue. Differences 
in the microbiota composition in different anatomical colorectal tumor sites and 
their potential association with KRAS mutation were also explored. In this study,
the number of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria decreased, while the number of
Fusobacteria increased in the gut of CRC patients. In addition, at the genus
level, Fusobacterium was identified as the key contributor to CRC tumorigenesis. 
In addition, a different distribution of gut microbiota in ascending and
descending colon cancer samples was observed. Lipopolysaccharide
biosynthesis-associated microbial genes were enriched in tumor tissues. Our study
suggests that specific mucosa-associated microbiota signature and function are
significantly changed in the gut of CRC patients, which may provide insight into 
the progression of CRC. These findings could also be of value in the creation of 
new prevention and treatment strategies for this type of cancer.

Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a specific species of gut microbiota, has been
suggested to be enriched in the microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) molecular
subtype of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). However, the clinicopathologic and
molecular factors that interact with Fn in MSI-H CRCs are poorly understood. In
this study, 16S ribosomal RNA gene DNA sequence of Fn was quantitatively measured
by real-time polymerase chain reaction in tumor DNA samples from a total of 160
surgically resected MSI-H CRC tissues. Each case was classified into one of the
three categories based on the Fn DNA amount: Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative.
The clinicopathologic and molecular associations of Fn in MSI-H CRCs were
statistically analyzed. Among the 160 MSI-H CRC samples, 15 (9%), 92 (58%), and
53 (33%) cases were Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative, respectively. Compared with
Fn-low/negative tumors, Fn-high MSI-H CRCs were significantly associated with a
high density of CD68+ tumor-infiltrating macrophages (P = 0.019) and promoter CpG
island hypermethylation of the CDKN2A (p16) gene (P = 0.008). There were also
tendencies toward associations of Fn-high with the BRAF V600E mutation
(P = 0.047) and active Crohn-like lymphoid reactions (P = 0.052) in MSI-H CRCs.
However, Fn-high was not significantly associated with CD3+ T cell density,
CD163+ M2 macrophage density or PD-L1 expression status. In conclusion, high
amounts of intratumoral Fn are correlated with increased macrophage infiltration 
and CDKN2A promoter methylation in MSI-H CRCs.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in both
men and women. The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as having an
important role in human health and disease. Fusobacterium has been identified in 
former studies as a leading gut bacterium associated with colorectal cancer, but 
it is still not clear if it plays an oncogenic role. In the current study, fecal 
samples were collected prior to bowel preparation from participants of screening 
colonoscopy in the German BliTz study. Using 16S rRNA gene analysis, we examined 
the presence and relative abundance of Fusobacterium in fecal samples from 500
participants, including 46, 113, 110 and 231 individuals with colorectal cancer, 
advanced adenomas, non-advanced adenomas and without any neoplasms, respectively.
We found that the abundance of Fusobacterium in feces was strongly associated
with the presence of colorectal cancer (P-value < 0.0001). This was confirmed by 
PCR at the species level for Fusobacterium nucleatum. However, no association was
seen with the presence of advanced adenomas (P-value = 0.80) or non-advanced
adenomas (P-value = 0.80), nor were there any associations observed with dietary 
or lifestyle habits. Although a causal role cannot be ruled out, our
observations, based on fecal microbiome, support the hypothesis that
Fusobacterium is a passenger that multiplies in the more favorable conditions
caused by the malignant tumor rather than a causal factor in colorectal cancer
development.

OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is higher in African Americans (AAs)
compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). A diet high in animal protein and fat
is an environmental risk factor for CRC development. The intestinal microbiota is
postulated to modulate the effects of diet in promoting or preventing CRC.
Hydrogen sulfide, produced by autochthonous sulfidogenic bacteria, triggers
proinflammatory pathways and hyperproliferation, and is genotoxic. We
hypothesised that sulfidogenic bacterial abundance in colonic mucosa may be an
environmental CRC risk factor that distinguishes AA and NHW.
DESIGN: Colonic biopsies from uninvolved or healthy mucosa from CRC cases and
tumour-free controls were collected prospectively from five medical centres in
Chicago for association studies. Sulfidogenic bacterial abundance in uninvolved
colonic mucosa of AA and NHW CRC cases was compared with normal mucosa of AA and 
NHW controls. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing was performed in AA cases and
controls. Correlations were examined among bacterial targets, race, disease
status and dietary intake.
RESULTS: AAs harboured a greater abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria compared with
NHWs regardless of disease status. Bilophila wadsworthia-specific dsrA was more
abundant in AA cases than controls. Linear discriminant analysis of 16S rRNA gene
sequences revealed five sulfidogenic genera that were more abundant in AA cases. 
Fat and protein intake and daily servings of meat were significantly higher in
AAs compared with NHWs, and multiple dietary components correlated with a higher 
abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria.
CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate sulfidogenic bacteria as a potential
environmental risk factor contributing to CRC development in AAs.

BACKGROUND: The equilibrium of oral microbiome may be altered by environmental
factors, including cigarette smoking. Several recent studies also suggest that
oral pathogens causing periodontal disease, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, are 
involved in pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.
METHODS: For this study oral rinse DNA samples from 190 participants in a
population-based case-control study for colorectal cancer were used to amplify a 
V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The amplicons were sequenced using
Illumina MiSeq paired end chemistry on two runs, yielding approximately 35
million filtered reads which were assigned to bacterial phyla.
RESULTS: No association was found between Fusobacterium abundance or presence and
colorectal cancer. However, adjusted for age and experimental batch, colorectal
cancer history was associated with increased presence of genus Lactobacillus and 
increased relative abundance of Rothia by 28% and current smoking was associated 
with a 33% decrease in relative counts of Betaproteobacteria (primarily
Neisseria) and 23% increase in relative abundance of Veillonellaceae family. We
also found that smoking had significant effects on the 2nd component scores and
2nd coordinate distances in principal component and coordinate analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: It remains to be elucidated whether the observed differences can be 
translated into biochemical changes in oral environment, thus potentially
affecting oral health.

Predicting colorectal cancer (CRC) based on fecal microbiota presents a promising
method for non-invasive screening of CRC, but the optimization of classification 
models remains an unaddressed question. The purpose of this study was to
systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different supervised
machine-learning models in predicting CRC in two independent eastern and western 
populations. The structures of intestinal microflora in feces in Chinese
population (N = 141) were determined by 454 FLX pyrosequencing, and different
supervised classifiers were employed to predict CRC based on fecal microbiota
operational taxonomic unit (OTUs). As a result, Bayes Net and Random Forest
displayed higher accuracies than other algorithms in both populations, although
Bayes Net was found with a lower false negative rate than that of Random Forest. 
Gut microbiota-based prediction was more accurate than the standard fecal occult 
blood test (FOBT), and the combination of both approaches further improved the
prediction accuracy. Moreover, when unclassified OTUs were used as input, the
BayesDMNB text algorithm achieved higher accuracy in the Chinese population
(AUC=0.994). Taken together, our results suggest that Bayes Net classification
model combined with unclassified OTUs may present an accurate method for
predicting CRC based on the compositions of gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease arising from at least
two precursors-the conventional adenoma (CA) and the serrated polyp. We and
others have previously shown a relationship between the human gut microbiota and 
colorectal cancer; however, its relationship to the different early precursors of
colorectal cancer is understudied. We tested, for the first time, the
relationship of the gut microbiota to specific colorectal polyp types.
RESULTS: Gut microbiota were assessed in 540 colonoscopy-screened adults by 16S
rRNA gene sequencing of stool samples. Participants were categorized as CA cases 
(n = 144), serrated polyp cases (n = 73), or polyp-free controls (n = 323). CA
cases were further classified as proximal (n = 87) or distal (n = 55) and as
non-advanced (n = 121) or advanced (n = 22). Serrated polyp cases were further
classified as hyperplastic polyp (HP; n = 40) or sessile serrated adenoma (SSA;
n = 33). We compared gut microbiota diversity, overall composition, and
normalized taxon abundance among these groups. CA cases had lower species
richness in stool than controls (p = 0.03); in particular, this association was
strongest for advanced CA cases (p = 0.004). In relation to overall microbiota
composition, only distal or advanced CA cases differed significantly from
controls (p = 0.02 and p = 0.002). In taxon-based analysis, stool of CA cases was
depleted in a network of Clostridia operational taxonomic units from families
Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, and enriched in the classes
Bacilli and Gammaproteobacteria, order Enterobacteriales, and genera Actinomyces 
and Streptococcus (all q < 0.10). SSA and HP cases did not differ in diversity or
composition from controls, though sample size for these groups was small. Few
taxa were differentially abundant between HP cases or SSA cases and controls;
among them, class Erysipelotrichi was depleted in SSA cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that gut microbes may play a role in the early 
stages of colorectal carcinogenesis through the development of CAs. Findings may 
have implications for developing colorectal cancer prevention therapies targeting
early microbial drivers of colorectal carcinogenesis.

Sporadic and inflammatory forms of colorectal cancer (CRC) account for more than 
80% of cases. Recent publications have shown mechanistic evidence for the
involvement of gut bacteria in the development of both CRC-forms. Whereas, colon 
and rectal cancer have been routinely studied together as CRC, increasing
evidence show these to be distinct diseases. Also, the common use of fecal
samples to study microbial communities may reflect disease state but possibly not
the tumor microenvironment. We performed this study to evaluate differences in
bacterial communities found in tissue samples of 18 rectal-cancer subjects when
compared to 18 non-cancer controls. Samples were collected during exploratory
colonoscopy (non-cancer group) or during surgery for tumor excision
(rectal-cancer group). High throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4-V5 
region was conducted on the Ion PGM platform, reads were filtered using Qiime and
clustered using UPARSE. We observed significant increases in species richness and
diversity in rectal cancer samples, evidenced by the total number of OTUs and the
Shannon and Simpson indexes. Enterotyping analysis divided our cohort into two
groups, with the majority of rectal cancer samples clustering into one
enterotype, characterized by a greater abundance of Bacteroides and Dorea. At the
phylum level, rectal-cancer samples had increased abundance of candidate phylum
OD1 (also known as Parcubacteria) whilst non-cancer samples had increased
abundance of Planctomycetes. At the genera level, rectal-cancer samples had
higher abundances of Bacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Parabacteroides,
Desulfovibrio, and Odoribacter whereas non-cancer samples had higher abundances
of Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Acinetobacter, Lactobacillus, and Bacillus. Two
Bacteroides fragilis OTUs were more abundant among rectal-cancer patients seen
through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, whose presence was confirmed by
immunohistochemistry and enrichment verified by digital droplet PCR. Our findings
point to increased bacterial richness and diversity in rectal cancer, along with 
several differences in microbial community composition. Our work is the first to 
present evidence for a possible role of bacteria such as B. fragilis and the
phylum Parcubacteria in rectal cancer, emphasizing the need to study
tissue-associated bacteria and specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract in 
order to better understand the possible links between the microbiota and rectal
cancer.

BACKGROUND: There is a significant demand for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
methods that are noninvasive, inexpensive, and capable of accurately detecting
early stage tumors. It has been shown that models based on the gut microbiota can
complement the fecal occult blood test and fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
However, a barrier to microbiota-based screening is the need to collect and store
a patient's stool sample.
RESULTS: Using stool samples collected from 404 patients, we tested whether the
residual buffer containing resuspended feces in FIT cartridges could be used in
place of intact stool samples. We found that the bacterial DNA isolated from FIT 
cartridges largely recapitulated the community structure and membership of
patients' stool microbiota and that the abundance of bacteria associated with CRC
were conserved. We also found that models for detecting CRC that were generated
using bacterial abundances from FIT cartridges were equally predictive as models 
generated using bacterial abundances from stool.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential for using residual buffer
from FIT cartridges in place of stool for microbiota-based screening for CRC.
This may reduce the need to collect and process separate stool samples and may
facilitate combining FIT and microbiota-based biomarkers into a single test.
Additionally, FIT cartridges could constitute a novel data source for studying
the role of the microbiome in cancer and other diseases.

BACKGROUND: Despite many potential effects of the oral microbiome on oral and
systemic health, scant information is available regarding the associations
between diet and the oral microbiome.
METHODS: Oral rinse DNA samples from 182 participants in a population-based
case-control study for colorectal cancer were used to amplify a V3-V4 region of
bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The amplicons were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq paired
end chemistry on 2 runs, yielding approximately 33 million filtered reads that
were assigned to bacterial classes. Relative abundances of each class and family 
as well microbial diversity/richness indices were correlated with selected
dietary intakes from a food frequency questionnaire.
RESULTS: Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and vitamin C intakes were consistently
correlated with alpha (within-subjects) diversity indexes in both richness and
diversity. SFA intake was positively correlated with relative abundance of
betaproteobacteria and fusobacteria. Vitamin C and other vitamins with correlated
intakes-for example, the B vitamins and vitamin E-exhibited positive correlations
with fusobacteria class, its family Leptotrichiaceae and a clostridia family
Lachnospiraceae. In addition, glycemic load was positively correlated with
Lactobacillaceae abundance.
CONCLUSION: The observed associations in this study were modest. However, the
results suggest that the effects of diets are likely to be habitat specific, and 
observations from the gut microbiome are not transferrable to the oral
microbiome. Further studies are warranted, incorporating a range of host
biomarkers, such as cytohistological, molecular, or biochemical measurements, in 
order to address biological consequences of these dietary intakes in human oral
health.

BACKGROUND: Adenomatous polyps are the most common precursor to colorectal
cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. We
sought to learn more about early events of carcinogenesis by investigating shifts
in the gut microbiota of patients with adenomas.
METHODS: We analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequences from the fecal microbiota of
patients with adenomas (n = 233) and without (n = 547).
RESULTS: Multiple taxa were significantly more abundant in patients with
adenomas, including Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, proinflammatory bacteria in the
genus Mogibacterium, and multiple Bacteroidetes species. Patients without
adenomas had greater abundances of Veillonella, Firmicutes (Order Clostridia),
and Actinobacteria (family Bifidobacteriales). Our findings were consistent with 
previously reported shifts in the gut microbiota of colorectal cancer patients.
Importantly, the altered adenoma profile is predicted to increase primary and
secondary bile acid production, as well as starch, sucrose, lipid, and
phenylpropanoid metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: These data hint that increased sugar, protein, and lipid metabolism 
along with increased bile acid production could promote a colonic environment
that supports the growth of bile-tolerant microbes such as Bilophilia and
Desulfovibrio In turn, these microbes may produce genotoxic or inflammatory
metabolites such as H2S and secondary bile acids, which could play a role in
catalyzing adenoma development and eventually colorectal cancer.
IMPACT: This study suggests a plausible biological mechanism to explain the links
between shifts in the microbiota and colorectal cancer. This represents a first
step toward resolving the complex interactions that shape the adenoma-carcinoma
sequence of colorectal cancer and may facilitate personalized therapeutics
focused on the microbiota. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(1); 85-94. ©2016

Recent reports have suggested that the gut microbiota is involved in the
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The composition of gut microbiota in CRC 
precursors has not been adequately described. To characterize the structure of
adherent microbiota in this disease, we conducted pyrosequencing-based analysis
of 16S rRNA genes to determine the bacterial profile of normal colons (healthy
controls) and colorectal adenomas (CRC precursors). Adenoma mucosal biopsy
samples and adjacent normal colonic mucosa from 31 patients with adenomas and 20 
healthy volunteers were profiled using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Principal
coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed structural segregation between colorectal
adenomatous tissue and control tissue. Alpha diversity estimations revealed
higher microbiota diversity in samples from patients with adenomas. Taxonomic
analysis illustrated that abundance of eight phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria,
Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Candidate-division
TM7, and Tenericutes) was significantly different. In addition, Lactococcus and
Pseudomonas were enriched in preneoplastic tissue, whereas Enterococcus,
Bacillus, and Solibacillus were reduced. However, both PCoA and cluster tree
analyses showed similar microbiota structure between adenomatous and adjacent
non-adenoma tissues. These present findings provide preliminary experimental
evidence supporting that colorectal preneoplastic lesion may be the most
important factor leading to alterations in bacterial community composition.

Fusobacteria are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and are amplified during
colorectal carcinogenesis. Compared to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence of
carcinogenesis, serrated neoplasm has distinct clinical features and a different 
molecular background. We aimed to compare the gut microbiome between tubular
adenoma (TA) and sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P). Patients with TA, SSA/P,
or CRC were recruited. Three pieces of colorectal mucosal tissue were obtained
from each patient by endoscopic biopsy. 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and
phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states 
(PICRUSt) were performed. Among 26 enrolled patients, 8, 10, and 8 had TA, SSA/P,
and CRC, respectively. The relative abundance of Fusobacteria did not differ
significantly between the TA and SSA/P groups (4.3% and 1.9%, P = 0.739) but was 
higher in the CRC group (33.8%) than in the TA or SSA/P group, respectively (TA
vs. CRC, P = 0.002, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.023; SSA/P vs. CRC, P < 0.001,
FDR = 0.001). PICRUSt revealed that most functions in the TA metagenome were
similar to those in the SSA/P metagenome. The gut microbiome, including relative 
abundance of Fusobacteria, did not differ between TA and SSA/P, suggesting that
Fusobacteria may contribute to both the serrated pathway and the
adenoma-carcinoma sequence.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death among
cancers in the United States. Although individuals diagnosed early have a greater
than 90% chance of survival, more than one-third of individuals do not adhere to 
screening recommendations partly because the standard diagnostics, colonoscopy
and sigmoidoscopy, are expensive and invasive. Thus, there is a great need to
improve the sensitivity of non-invasive tests to detect early stage cancers and
adenomas. Numerous studies have identified shifts in the composition of the gut
microbiota associated with the progression of CRC, suggesting that the gut
microbiota may represent a reservoir of biomarkers that would complement existing
non-invasive methods such as the widely used fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
METHODS: We sequenced the 16S rRNA genes from the stool samples of 490 patients. 
We used the relative abundances of the bacterial populations within each sample
to develop a random forest classification model that detects colonic lesions
using the relative abundance of gut microbiota and the concentration of
hemoglobin in stool.
RESULTS: The microbiota-based random forest model detected 91.7% of cancers and
45.5% of adenomas while FIT alone detected 75.0% and 15.7%, respectively. Of the 
colonic lesions missed by FIT, the model detected 70.0% of cancers and 37.7% of
adenomas. We confirmed known associations of Porphyromonas assaccharolytica,
Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Parvimonas micra, and Fusobacterium nucleatum with
CRC. Yet, we found that the loss of potentially beneficial organisms, such as
members of the Lachnospiraceae, was more predictive for identifying patients with
adenomas when used in combination with FIT.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential for microbiota analysis to 
complement existing screening methods to improve detection of colonic lesions.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Investigation of microbe-metabolite relationships in the gut
is needed to understand and potentially reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) risk.
METHODS: Microbiota and metabolomics profiling were performed on lyophilized
feces from 42 CRC cases and 89 matched controls. Multivariable logistic
regression was used to identify statistically independent associations with CRC. 
First principal coordinate-component pair (PCo1-PC1) and false discovery rate
(0.05)-corrected P-values were calculated for 116,000 Pearson correlations
between 530 metabolites and 220 microbes in a sex*case/control meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Overall microbe-metabolite PCo1-PC1 was more strongly correlated in
cases than in controls (Rho 0.606 vs 0.201, P = 0.01). CRC was independently
associated with lower levels of Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, p-aminobenzoate and 
conjugated linoleate, and with higher levels of Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas,
p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, and palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Through postulated effects
on cell shedding (palmitoyl-sphingomyelin), inflammation (conjugated linoleate), 
and innate immunity (p-aminobenzoate), metabolites mediated the CRC association
with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas by 29% and 34%, respectively. Overall,
palmitoyl-sphingomyelin correlated directly with abundances of Enterobacteriaceae
(Gammaproteobacteria), three Actinobacteria and five Firmicutes. Only
Parabacteroides correlated inversely with palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Other lipids
correlated inversely with Alcaligenaceae (Betaproteobacteria). Six
Bonferroni-significant correlations were found, including low indolepropionate
and threnoylvaline with Actinobacteria and high erythronate and an
uncharacterized metabolite with Enterobacteriaceae.
CONCLUSIONS: Feces from CRC cases had very strong microbe-metabolite correlations
that were predominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Actinobacteria. Metabolites
mediated a direct CRC association with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas, but not
an inverse association with Clostridia and Lachnospiraceae. This study identifies
complex microbe-metabolite networks that may provide insights on neoplasia and
targets for intervention.

OBJECTIVE: A signature that unifies the colorectal cancer (CRC) microbiota across
multiple studies has not been identified. In addition to methodological variance,
heterogeneity may be caused by both microbial and host response differences,
which was addressed in this study.
DESIGN: We prospectively studied the colonic microbiota and the expression of
specific host response genes using faecal and mucosal samples ('ON' and 'OFF' the
tumour, proximal and distal) from 59 patients undergoing surgery for CRC, 21
individuals with polyps and 56 healthy controls. Microbiota composition was
determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing; expression of host genes involved in 
CRC progression and immune response was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: The microbiota of patients with CRC differed from that of controls, but 
alterations were not restricted to the cancerous tissue. Differences between
distal and proximal cancers were detected and faecal microbiota only partially
reflected mucosal microbiota in CRC. Patients with CRC can be stratified based on
higher level structures of mucosal-associated bacterial co-abundance groups
(CAGs) that resemble the previously formulated concept of enterotypes. Of these, 
Bacteroidetes Cluster 1 and Firmicutes Cluster 1 were in decreased abundance in
CRC mucosa, whereas Bacteroidetes Cluster 2, Firmicutes Cluster 2, Pathogen
Cluster and Prevotella Cluster showed increased abundance in CRC mucosa.
CRC-associated CAGs were differentially correlated with the expression of host
immunoinflammatory response genes.
CONCLUSIONS: CRC-associated microbiota profiles differ from those in healthy
subjects and are linked with distinct mucosal gene-expression profiles.
Compositional alterations in the microbiota are not restricted to cancerous
tissue and differ between distal and proximal cancers.

OBJECTIVE: To compare fecal microbiota and metabolites between colorectal cancer 
(CRC) patients and healthy population.
METHODS: Feces from fifteen CRC patients and twelve normal people were analyzed
by using pyrosequencing and gas chromatography mass spectrometry(GC/MS).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the overall microbial community
structure associated with the disease state, but 18 bacterial genera were
underrepresented or overrepresented in the CRC samples. GC-MS profiling revealed 
higher concentrations for 9 kinds of amino acids and metabolites of short-chain
fatty acids, lower concentrations for 3 kinds of unsaturated fatty acids and 2
kinds of glycerin and ursodeoxycholic acid in stool samples from CRC patients.
Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential
relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species.
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in fecal metabolites and the
relative abundance of certain types of bacteria between CRC patients and healthy 
people, which can provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer 
environment and will help direct future mechanism studies.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
Japan. The etiology of CRC has been linked to numerous factors including genetic 
mutation, diet, life style, inflammation, and recently, the gut microbiota.
However, CRC-associated gut microbiota is still largely unexamined. This study
used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and
next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze and compare gut microbiota of
Japanese control subjects and Japanese patients with carcinoma in adenoma. Stool 
samples were collected from 49 control subjects, 50 patients with colon adenoma, 
and 9 patients with colorectal cancer (3/9 with invasive cancer and 6/9 with
carcinoma in adenoma) immediately before colonoscopy; DNA was extracted from each
stool sample. Based on T-RFLP analysis, 12 subjects (six control and six
carcinoma in adenoma subjects) were selected; their samples were used for NGS and
species-level analysis. T-RFLP analysis showed no significant differences in
bacterial population between control, adenoma and cancer groups. However, NGS
revealed that i), control and carcinoma in adenoma subjects had different gut
microbiota compositions, ii), one bacterial genus (Slackia) was significantly
associated with the control group and four bacterial genera (Actinomyces,
Atopobium, Fusobacterium, and Haemophilus) were significantly associated with the
carcinoma-in-adenoma group, and iii), several bacterial species were
significantly associated with each type (control: Eubacterium coprostanoligens;
carcinoma in adenoma: Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides fragiles,
Clostridium nexile, Fusobacterium varium, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Prevotella 
stercorea, Streptococcus gordonii, and Veillonella dispar). Gut microbial
properties differ between control subjects and carcinoma-in-adenoma patients in
this Japanese population, suggesting that gut microbiota is related to CRC
prevention and development.

Gut microbial dysbiosis contributes to the development of colorectal cancer
(CRC). Here we catalogue the microbial communities in human gut mucosae at
different stages of colorectal tumorigenesis. We analyse the gut mucosal
microbiome of 47 paired samples of adenoma and adenoma-adjacent mucosae, 52
paired samples of carcinoma and carcinoma-adjacent mucosae and 61 healthy
controls. Probabilistic partitioning of relative abundance profiles reveals that 
a metacommunity predominated by members of the oral microbiome is primarily
associated with CRC. Analysis of paired samples shows differences in community
configurations between lesions and the adjacent mucosae. Correlations of
bacterial taxa indicate early signs of dysbiosis in adenoma, and co-exclusive
relationships are subsequently more common in cancer. We validate these
alterations in CRC-associated microbiome by comparison with two previously
published data sets. Our results suggest that a taxonomically defined microbial
consortium is implicated in the development of CRC.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) from 
faecal metagenomes.
DESIGN: We performed metagenome-wide association studies on faecal samples from
74 patients with CRC and 54 controls from China, and validated the results in 16 
patients and 24 controls from Denmark. We further validated the biomarkers in two
published cohorts from France and Austria. Finally, we employed targeted
quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to evaluate diagnostic potential of selected
biomarkers in an independent Chinese cohort of 47 patients and 109 controls.
RESULTS: Besides confirming known associations of Fusobacterium nucleatum and
Peptostreptococcus stomatis with CRC, we found significant associations with
several species, including Parvimonas micra and Solobacterium moorei. We
identified 20 microbial gene markers that differentiated CRC and control
microbiomes, and validated 4 markers in the Danish cohort. In the French and
Austrian cohorts, these four genes distinguished CRC metagenomes from controls
with areas under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.77,
respectively. qPCR measurements of two of these genes accurately classified
patients with CRC in the independent Chinese cohort with AUC=0.84 and OR of 23.
These genes were enriched in early-stage (I-II) patient microbiomes, highlighting
the potential for using faecal metagenomic biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first metagenomic profiling study of CRC faecal
microbiomes to discover and validate microbial biomarkers in ethnically different
cohorts, and to independently validate selected biomarkers using an affordable
clinically relevant technology. Our study thus takes a step further towards
affordable non-invasive early diagnostic biomarkers for CRC from faecal samples.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence links colorectal cancer (CRC) with the
intestinal microbiota. However, the disturbance of intestinal microbiota and the 
role of Fusobacterium nucleatum during the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence 
have not yet been evaluated.
METHODS: 454 FLX pyrosequencing was used to evaluate the disturbance of
intestinal microbiota during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence pathway of CRC.
Intestinal microbiota and mucosa tumor-immune cytokines were detected in mice
after introducing 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), F. nucleatum or Berberine (BBR),
using pyrosequencing and Bio-Plex Pro™ cytokine assays, respectively. Protein
expressions were detected by western blotting.
RESULTS: The levels of opportunistic pathogens, such as Fusobacterium,
Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. gradually increased during the colorectal
adenoma-carcinoma sequence in human fecal and mucosal samples. F. nucleatum
treatment significantly altered lumen microbial structures, with increased
Tenericutes and Verrucomicrobia (opportunistic pathogens) (P < 0.05 = in
wild-type C57BL/6 and mice with DMH treatment). BBR intervention reversed the F. 
nucleatum-mediated increase in opportunistic pathogens, and the secretion of
IL-21/22/31, CD40L and the expression of p-STAT3, p-STAT5 and p-ERK1/2 in mice,
compared with mice fed with F. nucleatum alone.
CONCLUSIONS: F. nucleatum colonization in the intestine may prompt colorectal
tumorigenesis. BBR could rescue F. nucleatum-induced colorectal tumorigenesis by 
modulating the tumor microenvironment and blocking the activation of
tumorigenesis-related pathways.

BACKGROUND: Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous colorectal
adenoma (CRA) can detect curable disease. However, participation in colonoscopy
and sensitivity of fecal heme for CRA are low.
METHODS: Microbiota metrics were determined by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA
genes amplified from DNA extracted from feces self-collected in RNAlater. Among
fecal immunochemical test-positive (FIT +) participants, colonoscopically-defined
normal versus CRA patients were compared by regression, permutation, and random
forest plus leave-one-out methods.
FINDINGS: Of 95 FIT + participants, 61 had successful fecal microbiota profiling 
and colonoscopy, identifying 24 completely normal patients, 20 CRA patients, 2
CRC patients, and 15 with other conditions. Phylum-level fecal community
composition differed significantly between CRA and normal patients (permutation
P = 0.02). Rank phylum-level abundance distinguished CRA from normal patients
(area under the curve = 0.767, permutation P = 0.006). CRA prevalence was 59% in 
phylum-level cluster B versus 20% in cluster A (exact P = 0.01). Most of the
difference reflected 3-fold higher median relative abundance of Proteobacteria
taxa (Wilcoxon signed-rank P = 0.03, positive predictive value = 67%). Antibiotic
exposure and other potential confounders did not affect the associations.
INTERPRETATION: If confirmed in larger, more diverse populations, fecal
microbiota analysis might be employed to improve screening for CRA and ultimately
to reduce mortality from CRC.

BACKGROUND: The human gut microbiome is associated with the development of colon 
cancer, and recent studies have found changes in the microbiome in cancer
patients compared to healthy controls. Studying the microbial communities in the 
tumor microenvironment may shed light on the role of host-bacteria interactions
in colorectal cancer. Here, we highlight the major shifts in the colorectal tumor
microbiome relative to that of matched normal colon tissue from the same
individual, allowing us to survey the microbial communities in the tumor
microenvironment and providing intrinsic control for environmental and host
genetic effects on the microbiome.
METHODS: We sequenced the microbiome in 44 primary tumor and 44 patient-matched
normal colon tissue samples to determine differentially abundant microbial taxa
These data were also used to functionally characterize the microbiome of the
cancer and normal sample pairs and identify functional pathways enriched in the
tumor-associated microbiota.
RESULTS: We find that tumors harbor distinct microbial communities compared to
nearby healthy tissue. Our results show increased microbial diversity in the
tumor microenvironment, with changes in the abundances of commensal and
pathogenic bacterial taxa, including Fusobacterium and Providencia. While
Fusobacterium has previously been implicated in colorectal cancer, Providencia is
a novel tumor-associated agent which has not been identified in previous studies.
Additionally, we identified a clear, significant enrichment of predicted
virulence-associated genes in the colorectal cancer microenvironment, likely
dependent upon the genomes of Fusobacterium and Providencia.
CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies bacterial taxa significantly correlated with
colorectal cancer, including a novel finding of an elevated abundance of
Providencia in the tumor microenvironment. We also describe the predicted
metabolic pathways and enzymes differentially present in the tumor-associated
microbiome, and show an enrichment of virulence-associated bacterial genes in the
tumor microenvironment. This predicted virulence enrichment supports the
hypothesis that the microbiome plays an active role in colorectal cancer
development and/or progression. Our results provide a starting point for future
prognostic and therapeutic research with the potential to improve patient
outcomes.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world and the
second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US and Spain. The molecular
mechanisms involved in the etiology of CRC are not yet elucidated due in part to 
the complexity of the human gut microbiota. In this study, we compared the
microbiome composition of 90 tumor and matching adjacent tissue (adjacent) from
cohorts from the US and Spain by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in order to
determine the impact of the geographic origin on the CRC microbiome. Data showed 
a significantly (P < 0.05) higher Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) for the US (PD
Adjacent = 26.3 ± 5.3, PD Tumor = 23.3 ± 6.2) compared to the Spanish cohort (PD 
Adjacent = 18.9 ± 5.9, PD Tumor = 18.7 ± 6.6) while no significant differences in
bacterial diversity were observed between tumor and adjacent tissues for
individuals from the same country. Adjacent tissues from the Spanish cohort were 
enriched in Firmicutes (SP = 43.9% and US = 22.2%, P = 0.0001) and Actinobacteria
(SP = 1.6% and US = 0.5%, P = 0.0018) compared to US adjacent tissues, while
adjacent tissues from the US had significantly higher abundances of Fusobacteria 
(US = 8.1% and SP = 1.5%, P = 0.0023) and Sinergistetes (US = 0.3% and SP = 0.1%,
P = 0.0097). Comparisons between tumor and adjacent tissues in each cohort
identified the genus Eikenella significantly over represented in US tumors (T =
0.024% and A = 0%, P = 0.03), and the genera Fusobacterium (T = 10.4% and A =
1.5%, P = <0.0001), Bulleida (T = 0.36% and A = 0.09%, P = 0.02), Gemella (T =
1.46% and A = 0.19%, P = 0.03), Parvimonas (T = 3.14% and A = 0.86%, P = 0.03),
Campylobacter (T = 0.15% and A = 0.008%, P = 0.047), and Streptococcus (T = 2.84%
and A = 2.19%, P = 0.05) significantly over represented in Spanish tumors.
Predicted metagenome functional content from 16S rRNA surveys showed that
bacterial motility proteins and proteins involved in flagellar assembly were over
represented in adjacent tissues of both cohorts, while pathways involved in fatty
acid biosynthesis, the MAPK signaling pathway, and bacterial toxins were over
represented in tumors. Our study suggests that microbiome compositional and
functional dissimilarities by geographic location should be taken in
consideration when approaching CRC therapeutic options.

Colorectal cancer, a commonly diagnosed cancer in the elderly, often develops
slowly from benign polyps called adenoma. The gut microbiota is believed to be
directly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The identity and functional
capacity of the adenoma- or carcinoma-related gut microbe(s), however, have not
been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Here we perform a metagenome-wide
association study (MGWAS) on stools from advanced adenoma and carcinoma patients 
and from healthy subjects, revealing microbial genes, strains and functions
enriched in each group. An analysis of potential risk factors indicates that high
intake of red meat relative to fruits and vegetables appears to associate with
outgrowth of bacteria that might contribute to a more hostile gut environment.
These findings suggest that faecal microbiome-based strategies may be useful for 
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal adenoma or carcinoma.

The dysbiosis of the human intestinal microbiota is linked to sporadic colorectal
carcinoma (CRC). The present study was designed to investigate the gut microbiota
distribution features in CRC patients. We performed pyrosequencing based analysis
of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region to investigate microbiota of the cancerous tissue 
and adjacent non-cancerous normal tissue in proximal and distal CRC samples. The 
results revealed that the microbial structures of the CRC patients and healthy
individuals differed significantly. Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were
over-represented whereas Proteobacteria was under-represented in CRC patients. In
addition, Lactococcus and Fusobacterium exhibited a relatively higher abundance
while Pseudomonas and Escherichia-Shigella was reduced in cancerous tissues
compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Meanwhile, the overall microbial
structures of proximal and distal colon cancerous tissues were similar; but
certain potential pro-oncogenic pathogens were different. These results suggested
that the mucosa-associated microbiota is dynamically associated with CRC, which
may provide evidences for microbiota-associated diagnostic, prognostic,
preventive, and therapeutic strategies for CRC.

Environmental factors clearly affect colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence, but the
mechanisms through which these factors function are unknown. One prime candidate 
is an altered colonic microbiota. Here we show that the mucosal microbiota
organization is a critical factor associated with a subset of CRC. We identified 
invasive polymicrobial bacterial biofilms (bacterial aggregates), structures
previously associated with nonmalignant intestinal pathology, nearly universally 
(89%) on right-sided tumors (13 of 15 CRCs, 4 of 4 adenomas) but on only 12% of
left-sided tumors (2 of 15 CRCs, 0 of 2 adenomas). Surprisingly, patients with
biofilm-positive tumors, whether cancers or adenomas, all had biofilms on their
tumor-free mucosa far distant from their tumors. Bacterial biofilms were
associated with diminished colonic epithelial cell E-cadherin and enhanced
epithelial cell IL-6 and Stat3 activation, as well as increased crypt epithelial 
cell proliferation in normal colon mucosa. High-throughput sequencing revealed no
consistent bacterial genus associated with tumors, regardless of biofilm status. 
However, principal coordinates analysis revealed that biofilm communities on
paired normal mucosa, distant from the tumor itself, cluster with tumor
microbiomes as opposed to biofilm-negative normal mucosa bacterial communities
also from the tumor host. Colon mucosal biofilm detection may predict increased
risk for development of sporadic CRC.

Several bacterial species have been implicated in the development of colorectal
carcinoma (CRC), but CRC-associated changes of fecal microbiota and their
potential for cancer screening remain to be explored. Here, we used metagenomic
sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC 
patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants.
Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult
blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved > 
45% relative to the FOBT, while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of
metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early- and
late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control
populations (N = 335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the
fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at 
the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal
tumor-related host-microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift
from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino
acids in CRC patients, accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide
metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Tongue diagnosis, as a unique method of traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM), discriminates physiological functions and pathological conditions by
observing the changes of the tongue coating.
AIMS: To evaluate the differences of tongue images and tongue coating microbiome 
between patients with colorectal cancer and healthy people.
METHODS: The tongue diagnostic information acquisition system was used to
photograph the tongue images and analyze the thickness of the tongue coatings in 
patients with colorectal cancer and healthy people. The next-generation
sequencing technology was used to determine the V2-V4 hypervariable region of 16S
rDNA to investigate the microbial community structure and diversity on the tongue
coating.
RESULTS: The tongue coatings in patients with colorectal cancer were obvious
thickening compared with tongue images in healthy people. The microbial community
structure on the tongue coating was different between patients with colorectal
cancer and healthy people.
CONCLUSION: Tongue diagnosis may provide important leads towards novel
microbiome-related diagnostic tools and tongue coating microbiome may be a novel 
biomarker for characterizing patient with colorectal cancer.

Recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiome may be an important factor 
in the development of colorectal cancer. Abnormalities in the gut microbiome have
been reported in patients with colorectal cancer; however, this microbial
community has not been explored as a potential screen for early-stage disease. We
characterized the gut microbiome in patients from three clinical groups
representing the stages of colorectal cancer development: healthy, adenoma, and
carcinoma. Analysis of the gut microbiome from stool samples revealed both an
enrichment and depletion of several bacterial populations associated with
adenomas and carcinomas. Combined with known clinical risk factors of colorectal 
cancer (e.g., BMI, age, race), data from the gut microbiome significantly
improved the ability to differentiate between healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma
clinical groups relative to risk factors alone. Using Bayesian methods, we
determined that using gut microbiome data as a screening tool improved the
pretest to posttest probability of adenoma more than 50-fold. For example, the
pretest probability in a 65-year-old was 0.17% and, after using the microbiome
data, this increased to 10.67% (1 in 9 chance of having an adenoma). Taken
together, the results of our study demonstrate the feasibility of using the
composition of the gut microbiome to detect the presence of precancerous and
cancerous lesions. Furthermore, these results support the need for more
cross-sectional studies with diverse populations and linkage to other stool
markers, dietary data, and personal health information.

BACKGROUND: Both genetic and epigenetic alterations have been reported to act as 
driving forces of tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC), but a growing body of
evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota may be an aetiological factor in the
initiation and progression of CRC. Recently, the "driver-passenger" model for CRC
has connected these different factors, but little has been done to characterize
the CRC gut microbiome.
FINDINGS: Building on the driver-passenger model, we used 454 pyrosequencing of
bacterial 16S rRNA genes associated with 10 normal, 10 adenoma, and 8 tumor
biopsy samples, and found 7 potential driver bacterial genera and 12 potential
passenger bacterial genera (7 being pro-inflammatory and 5 anti-inflammatory).
Further analysis also showed certain co-expression patterns among different
clusters of bacteria that may potentially be related to the promotion or
progression of gut cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide preliminary experimental evidence
supporting the proposition of bacterial "driver-passenger model" for CRC, and
identified potentially novel microbial agents that may be connected to risk of
CRC in a Han Chinese population.

BACKGROUND: There is clear evidence that nutrition and lifestyle can modify
colorectal cancer risk. However, it is not clear if those factors can affect
colorectal cancer treatment, recurrence, survival and quality of life. This paper
describes the background and design of the "COlorectal cancer: Longitudinal,
Observational study on Nutritional and lifestyle factors that may influence
colorectal tumour recurrence, survival and quality of life" - COLON - study. The 
main aim of this study is to assess associations of diet and other lifestyle
factors, with colorectal cancer recurrence, survival and quality of life. We
extensively investigate diet and lifestyle of colorectal cancer patients at
diagnosis and during the following years; this design paper focusses on the
initial exposures of interest: diet and dietary supplement use, body composition,
nutrient status (e.g. vitamin D), and composition of the gut microbiota.
METHODS/DESIGN: The COLON study is a multi-centre prospective cohort study among 
at least 1,000 incident colorectal cancer patients recruited from 11 hospitals in
the Netherlands. Patients with colorectal cancer are invited upon diagnosis. Upon
recruitment, after 6 months, 2 years and 5 years, patients fill out
food-frequency questionnaires; questionnaires about dietary supplement use,
physical activity, weight, height, and quality of life; and donate blood samples.
Diagnostic CT-scans are collected to assess cross-sectional areas of skeletal
muscle, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and intermuscular fat, and to assess
muscle attenuation. Blood samples are biobanked to facilitate future analyse of
biomarkers, nutrients, DNA etc. Analysis of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels,
and analysis of metabolomic profiles are scheduled. A subgroup of patients with
colon cancer is asked to provide faecal samples before and at several time points
after colon resection to study changes in gut microbiota during treatment. For
all patients, information on vital status is retrieved by linkage with national
registries. Information on clinical characteristics is gathered from linkage with
the Netherlands Cancer Registry and with hospital databases. Hazards ratios will 
be calculated for dietary and lifestyle factors at diagnosis in relation to
recurrence and survival. Repeated measures analyses will be performed to assess
changes over time in dietary and other factors in relation to recurrence and
survival.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies demonstrate a link between gastrointestinal
cancers and environmental factors such as diet. It has been suggested that
environmental cancer risk is determined by the interaction between diet and
microbes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that
microbiota composition during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression might differ
depending on the stage of the disease.
METHODS: A total of 28 age-matched and sex-matched subjects, seven with CRC
adenocarcinoma, 11 with tubular adenomas and ten healthy subjects with intact
colon, were included into the study. Microbiomes from mucosal and fecal samples
were analyzed with 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing, together with
quantitative PCR of specific bacteria and archaea.
RESULTS: The principal coordinates analysis clearly separated healthy tissue
samples from polyps and tumors, supporting the presence of specific bacterial
consortia that are associated with affected sites and that can serve as potential
biomarkers of CRC progression. A higher presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and
Enterobacteriaceae was found by qPCR in samples from CRC compared to healthy
controls. We observed a correlation between CRC process development and levels of
Methanobacteriales (R = 0.537, P = 0.007) and Methanobrevibacterium (R = 0.574, P
= 0.03) in fecal samples.
CONCLUSION: Differences in microbial and archaeal composition between mucosal
samples from healthy and disease tissues were observed in tubular adenoma and
adenocarcinoma. In addition, microbiota from mucosal samples represented the
underlying dysbiosis, whereas fecal samples seem not to be appropriate to detect 
shifts in microbial composition. CRC risk is influenced by microbial composition,
showing differences according to disease progression step and tumor severity.

BACKGROUND: Numerous cancers have been linked to microorganisms. Given that
colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths and the colon is
continuously exposed to a high diversity of microbes, the relationship between
gut mucosal microbiome and colorectal cancer needs to be explored. Metagenomic
studies have shown an association between Fusobacterium species and colorectal
carcinoma. Here, we have extended these studies with deeper sequencing of a much 
larger number (n = 130) of colorectal carcinoma and matched normal control
tissues. We analyzed these data using co-occurrence networks in order to identify
microbe-microbe and host-microbe associations specific to tumors.
RESULTS: We confirmed tumor over-representation of Fusobacterium species and
observed significant co-occurrence within individual tumors of Fusobacterium,
Leptotrichia and Campylobacter species. This polymicrobial signature was
associated with over-expression of numerous host genes, including the gene
encoding the pro-inflammatory chemokine Interleukin-8. The tumor-associated
bacteria we have identified are all Gram-negative anaerobes, recognized
previously as constituents of the oral microbiome, which are capable of causing
infection. We isolated a novel strain of Campylobacter showae from a colorectal
tumor specimen. This strain is substantially diverged from a previously sequenced
oral Campylobacter showae isolate, carries potential virulence genes, and
aggregates with a previously isolated tumor strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
CONCLUSIONS: A polymicrobial signature of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria is
associated with colorectal carcinoma tissue.

BACKGROUND: Colonic polyps are common tumors occurring in ~50% of Western
populations with ~10% risk of malignant progression. Dietary agents have been
considered the primary environmental exposure to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) 
development. However, the colonic mucosa is permanently in contact with the
microbiota and its metabolic products including toxins that also have the
potential to trigger oncogenic transformation.
AIM: To analyze fecal DNA for microbiota composition and functional potential in 
African Americans with pre-neoplastic lesions.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We analyzed the bacterial composition of stool samples from 
6 healthy individuals and 6 patients with colon polyps using 16S ribosomal
RNA-based phylogenetic microarray; the Human intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) and 
16S rRNA gene barcoded 454 pyrosequencing. The functional potential was
determined by sequence-based metagenomics using 454 pyrosequencing.
RESULTS: Fecal microbiota profiling of samples from the healthy and polyp
patients using both a phylogenetic microarraying (HITChip) and barcoded 454
pyrosequencing generated similar results. A distinction between both sets of
samples was only obtained when the analysis was performed at the sub-genus level.
Most of the species leading to the dissociation were from the Bacteroides group. 
The metagenomic analysis did not reveal major differences in bacterial gene
prevalence/abundances between the two groups even when the analysis and
comparisons were restricted to available Bacteroides genomes.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that at the pre-neoplastic stages, there is a
trend showing microbiota changes between healthy and colon polyp patients at the 
sub-genus level. These differences were not reflected at the genome/functions
levels. Bacteria and associated functions within the Bacteroides group need to be
further analyzed and dissected to pinpoint potential actors in the early colon
oncogenic transformation in a large sample size.

We tested the hypothesis that an altered community of gut microbes is associated 
with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a study of 47 CRC case subjects and 94
control subjects. 16S rRNA genes in fecal bacterial DNA were amplified by
universal primers, sequenced by 454 FLX technology, and aligned for taxonomic
classification to microbial genomes using the QIIME pipeline. Taxonomic
differences were confirmed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
adjusted for false discovery rate. All statistical tests were two-sided. From
794217 16S rRNA gene sequences, we found that CRC case subjects had decreased
overall microbial community diversity (P = .02). In taxonomy-based analyses,
lower relative abundance of Clostridia (68.6% vs 77.8%) and increased carriage of
Fusobacterium (multivariable odds ratio [OR] = 4.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]
= 1.62 to 10.47) and Porphyromonas (OR = 5.17; 95% CI = 1.75 to 15.25) were found
in case subjects compared with control subjects. Because of the potentially
modifiable nature of the gut bacteria, our findings may have implications for CRC
prevention.

In this study we used stool profiling to identify intestinal bacteria and
metabolites that are differentially represented in humans with colorectal cancer 
(CRC) compared to healthy controls to identify how microbial functions may
influence CRC development. Stool samples were collected from healthy adults
(n = 10) and colorectal cancer patients (n = 11) prior to colon resection surgery
at the University of Colorado Health-Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, CO. 
The V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene was pyrosequenced and both short chain fatty
acids and global stool metabolites were extracted and analyzed utilizing Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). There were no significant differences
in the overall microbial community structure associated with the disease state,
but several bacterial genera, particularly butyrate-producing species, were
under-represented in the CRC samples, while a mucin-degrading species,
Akkermansia muciniphila, was about 4-fold higher in CRC (p<0.01). Proportionately
higher amounts of butyrate were seen in stool of healthy individuals while
relative concentrations of acetate were higher in stools of CRC patients. GC-MS
profiling revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples from CRC
patients and higher poly and monounsaturated fatty acids and ursodeoxycholic
acid, a conjugated bile acid in stool samples from healthy adults (p<0.01).
Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential
relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species. These
associations could provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer
environment and will help direct future mechanistic studies. Using integrated
"omics" approaches may prove a useful tool in identifying functional groups of
gastrointestinal bacteria and their associated metabolites as novel therapeutic
and chemopreventive targets.

The human gut microbiota is a complex system that is essential to the health of
the host. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may play an
important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we 
used pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region to characterize the fecal
microbiota of 19 patients with CRC and 20 healthy control subjects. The results
revealed striking differences in fecal microbial population patterns between
these two groups. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed that 17
phylotypes closely related to Bacteroides were enriched in the gut microbiota of 
CRC patients, whereas nine operational taxonomic units, represented by the
butyrate-producing genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, were significantly less
abundant. A positive correlation was observed between the abundance of
Bacteroides species and CRC disease status (R = 0.462, P = 0.046 < 0.5). In
addition, 16 genera were significantly more abundant in CRC samples than in
controls, including potentially pathogenic Fusobacterium and Campylobacter
species at genus level. The dysbiosis of fecal microbiota, characterized by the
enrichment of potential pathogens and the decrease in butyrate-producing members,
may therefore represent a specific microbial signature of CRC. A greater
understanding of the dynamics of the fecal microbiota may assist in the
development of novel fecal microbiome-related diagnostic tools for CRC.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that diet is one of the most
important environmental factors involved in the progression from advanced
colorectal adenoma (A-CRA) to colorectal cancer.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the possible effects of dietary fiber on the fecal
microbiota of patients with A-CRA.
DESIGN: Patients with a diagnosis of A-CRA by pathological examination were
enrolled in the A-CRA group. Patients with no obvious abnormalities or
histopathological changes were enrolled in the healthy control (HC) group.
Dietary fiber intake was assessed in all patients. Short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) in feces were detected by gas chromatography. The fecal microbiota
community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing based on 16S ribosomal RNA.
RESULTS: Lower dietary fiber patterns and consistently lower SCFA production were
observed in the A-CRA group (n = 344). Principal component analysis showed
distinct differences in the fecal microbiota communities of the 2 groups.
Clostridium, Roseburia, and Eubacterium spp. were significantly less prevalent in
the A-CRA group (n = 47) than in the HC group (n = 47), whereas Enterococcus and 
Streptococcus spp. were more prevalent in the A-CRA group (n = 47) (all P <
0.05). Butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria were more prevalent in a subgroup
of HC subjects with a high fiber intake than in those in both the low-fiber HC
subgroup and the high-fiber A-CRA subgroup (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A high-fiber dietary pattern and subsequent consistent production of 
SCFAs and healthy gut microbiota are associated with a reduced risk of A-CRA.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to expand existing knowledge about the
CRC-associated microbiome among Han Chinese, and to further discover the
variation pattern of the human CRC microbiome across all population.
FINDINGS: Using pyrosequencing-based molecular monitoring of bacterial 16S rRNA
gene from eight tumor/normal tissue pairs of eight Chinese CRC patients, we
analyzed and characterized the basic features of the CRC-associated microbiome.
Firstly, we discovered an increasing diversity among tumor-associated bacterial
communities. Secondly, in 50% of Chinese CRC patients, we found a significant
increase of Roseburia (P = 0.017), and a concurrent decrease of both
Microbacterium (P = 0.009) and Anoxybacillus (P = 0.009) in tumor tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a novel CRC microbiome pattern in Chinese. Both the
over-represented Roseburia bacteria at tumor sites and the over-represented
Microbacterium and Anoxybacillus bacteria away from tumor sites were both closely
related in Chinese CRC patients. Across several populations reported in this
study and previously, we observed both common and distinctive patterns of human
CRC microbiome's association with a high-risk of CRC.

Recent reports have suggested the involvement of gut microbiota in the
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). We utilized pyrosequencing based analysis
of 16S rRNA genes to determine the overall structure of microbiota in patients
with colorectal cancer and healthy controls; we investigated microbiota of the
intestinal lumen, the cancerous tissue and matched noncancerous normal tissue.
Moreover, we investigated the mucosa-adherent microbial composition using rectal 
swab samples because the structure of the tissue-adherent bacterial community is 
potentially altered following bowel cleansing. Our findings indicated that the
microbial structure of the intestinal lumen and cancerous tissue differed
significantly. Phylotypes that enhance energy harvest from diets or perform
metabolic exchange with the host were more abundant in the lumen. There were more
abundant Firmicutes and less abundant Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in lumen. 
The overall microbial structures of cancerous tissue and noncancerous tissue were
similar; however the tumor microbiota exhibited lower diversity. The structures
of the intestinal lumen microbiota and mucosa-adherent microbiota were different 
in CRC patients compared to matched microbiota in healthy individuals.
Lactobacillales was enriched in cancerous tissue, whereas Faecalibacterium was
reduced. In the mucosa-adherent microbiota, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium,
and Blautia were reduced in CRC patients, whereas Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas,
Peptostreptococcus, and Mogibacterium were enriched. In the lumen, predominant
phylotypes related to metabolic disorders or metabolic exchange with the host,
Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Coriobacteriaceae were increased in
cancer patients. Coupled with previous reports, these results suggest that the
intestinal microbiota is associated with CRC risk and that intestinal lumen
microflora potentially influence CRC risk via cometabolism or metabolic exchange 
with the host. However, mucosa-associated microbiota potentially affects CRC risk
primarily through direct interaction with the host.

Differences in the composition of the gut microbial community have been
associated with diseases such as obesity, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
colorectal cancer (CRC). We used 454 titanium pyrosequencing of the V1-V2 region 
of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize adherent bacterial communities in mucosal
biopsy samples from 33 subjects with adenomas and 38 subjects without adenomas
(controls). Biopsy samples from subjects with adenomas had greater numbers of
bacteria from 87 taxa than controls; only 5 taxa were more abundant in control
samples. The magnitude of the differences in the distal gut microbiota between
patients with adenomas and controls was more pronounced than that of any other
clinical parameters including obesity, diet or family history of CRC. This
suggests that sequence analysis of the microbiota could be used to identify
patients at risk for developing adenomas.

The present report summarises key insights from a recent symposium focusing on
the impact of the intestinal microbiota on health and disease. A more appropriate
definition of health was proposed since health maintenance is a dynamic process
better assessed in terms of ability to adapt to stress and maintain physiological
homeostasis. Biomarkers specifically for health are needed; use of challenge
models and subjects with suboptimal health or specific disease risk were advised.
The complexity of interactions between external factors, the intestinal
epithelium, intestinal microbiota, the immune system and health was exemplified
by describing the effects of antibiotics, the Western diet and non-digestible
carbohydrates on the microbiota. The association of certain bacteria with
different states of health or disease was acknowledged but also that is not
always clear whether this is a cause or effect. Recent identification of three
robust faecal metagenome clusters may advance this understanding. It was
speculated that knowledge of the intestinal microbiota profile may eventually
help in the diagnosis of health risks and choice of therapy. It was agreed that
beneficial manipulation of the commensal microbiota can improve health outcome.
For this purpose, three areas were reviewed. Firstly, research into probiotics as
vaccine adjuvants was considered useful for substantiation of immune function
claims. Secondly, positive results with certain probiotics and synbiotics for
colorectal cancer are emerging, mostly from in vitro and animal studies. Finally,
studies in endurance athletes have shown strain-specific probiotic benefit in
terms of maintenance of immune function and, for certain strains, reduction of
episodes of respiratory and/or gastrointestinal tract infections.

Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) strains have been suggested to be
associated with acute and persistent diarrheal disease, inflammatory bowel
disease and colorectal cancer, although further epidemiological studies are
needed for clarification. Here, a pilot study was performed to examine the effect
of the oral administration of yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain on the 
cell numbers of fecal ETBF in a healthy population. Among 420 healthy adults, 38 
subjects were found to be ETBF carriers, giving a prevalence of approximately 9%.
Among them, 32 subjects were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel-group
study to ingest yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium
longum BB536 (BB536Y group), for 8 weeks, with milk provided to the control group
(milk group). The cell numbers of ETBF and the dominant species of the B.
fragilis group were measured by a quantitative PCR method. Compared with the
baseline values, there was a significant decrease in the cell number of ETBF at
week 8 in the BB536Y group but not in the milk group. Linear mixed models
analysis for longitudinal data revealed a significant difference in the changes
of ETBF cell number between the two groups during the intervention phase. These
results imply the potential of probiotic yogurt for eliminating ETBF in the
microbiota, but its clinical significance needs to be evaluated in the future.
This is the first report of a possible effect of probiotic intake on ETBF in the 
microbiota.

The tumor microenvironment of colorectal carcinoma is a complex community of
genomically altered cancer cells, nonneoplastic cells, and a diverse collection
of microorganisms. Each of these components may contribute to carcinogenesis;
however, the role of the microbiota is the least well understood. We have
characterized the composition of the microbiota in colorectal carcinoma using
whole genome sequences from nine tumor/normal pairs. Fusobacterium sequences were
enriched in carcinomas, confirmed by quantitative PCR and 16S rDNA sequence
analysis of 95 carcinoma/normal DNA pairs, while the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
phyla were depleted in tumors. Fusobacteria were also visualized within
colorectal tumors using FISH. These findings reveal alterations in the colorectal
cancer microbiota; however, the precise role of Fusobacteria in colorectal
carcinoma pathogenesis requires further investigation.

On the relationship between sialomucin and sulfomucin expression and
hydrogenotrophic microbes in the human colonic mucosa.

The colonic mucus layer is comprised primarily of acidomucins, which provide
viscous properties and can be broadly classified into sialomucins or sulfomucins 
based on the presence of terminating sialic acid or sulfate groups. Differences
in acidomucin chemotypes have been observed in diseases such as colorectal cancer
and inflammatory bowel disease, and variation in sialo- and sulfomucin content
may influence microbial colonization. For example, sulfate derived from
sulfomucin degradation may promote the colonization of sulfate-reducing bacteria 
(SRB), which through sulfate respiration generate the genotoxic gas hydrogen
sulfide. Here, paired biopsies from right colon, left colon, and rectum of 20
subjects undergoing routine screening colonoscopies were collected to enable
parallel histochemical and microbiological studies. Goblet cell sialo- and
sulfomucins in each biopsy were distinguished histochemically and quantified.
Quantitative PCR and multivariate analyses were used to examine the abundance of 
hydrogenotrophic microbial groups and SRB genera relative to acidomucin profiles.
Regional variation was observed in sialomucins and sulfomucins with the greatest 
abundance of each found in the rectum. Mucin composition did not appear to
influence the abundance of SRB or other hydrogenotrophic microbiota but
correlated with the composition of different SRB genera. A higher sulfomucin
proportion correlated with higher quantities of Desulfobacter, Desulfobulbus and 
Desulfotomaculum, relative to the predominant Desulfovibrio genus. Thus,
acidomucin composition may influence bacterial sulfate respiration in the human
colon, which may in turn impact mucosal homeostasis. These results stress the
need to consider mucus characteristics in the context of studies of the
microbiome that target intestinal diseases.

Evidence supports involvement of microflora in the transition of chronic
inflammation to neoplasia. We investigated the protective efficacy of the
probiotic VSL#3 in a model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Chronic
colitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by administration of trinitrobenzene
sulfonic acid (TNBS), followed 6 wk later by systemic reactivation. To induce
colitis-associated dysplasia and cancer, the animals received TNBS
(intravenously) twice a week for 10 wk. One group received VSL#3 in drinking
water from 1 wk before colitis induction until death. The colons were examined
for damage and presence of dysplasia or cancer. Samples were analyzed for cell
proliferation and apoptosis, vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, angiogenic
factors, and presence of alkaline sphingomyelinase or phosphatase. Microbial
community composition was evaluated by terminal restriction fragment-length
polymorphism analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. None of the
probiotic-treated animals developed carcinoma, and no high-grade dysplasia was
found in either the proximal or mid colon. In contrast, 29% of the animals in the
control group developed carcinoma in one or more regions of the colon.
VSL#3-treated animals had significantly less damage than the vehicle
treated-controls in all areas of the colon, and this correlated with decreased
richness and diversity of the mucosally adherent microbiota. Treatment with the
probiotic increased the antiangiogenic factor angiostatin, VDR expression, and
alkaline sphingomyelinase. We concluded that pretreatment with the probiotic
VSL#3 can attenuate various inflammatory-associated parameters, delaying
transition to dysplasia and cancer, thus offering its potential therapeutic use
in patients with long-standing colitis.

healthy volunteers.

Despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer
(CRC), the composition of gut microbiota in CRC patients has not been adequately 
described. In this study, fecal bacterial diversity in CRC patients (n=46) and
healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the V3 region of
the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Both principal component analysis and UniFrac
analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. Forty-eight
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by redundancy analysis as key 
variables significantly associated with the structural difference. One OTU
closely related to Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of CRC
patients, whereas three OTUs related to Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides
uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. A total of 11 OTUs
belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella,
Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut 
microbiota of CRC patients, and 5 OTUs belonging to the genus Roseburia and other
butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae were less abundant.
Real-time quantitative PCR further validated the significant reduction of
butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of CRC patients by measuring
the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme A CoA transferase genes (Mann-Whitney test, 
P<0.01). Reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens 
may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in CRC patients.

The gut microbiota is a remarkable asset for human health. As a key element in
the development and prevention of specific diseases, its study has yielded a new 
field of promising biotherapeutics. This review provides comprehensive and
updated knowledge of the human gut microbiota, its implications in health and
disease, and the potentials and limitations of its modification by currently
available biotherapeutics to treat, prevent and/or restore human health, and
future directions. Homeostasis of the gut microbiota maintains various functions 
which are vital to the maintenance of human health. Disruption of the intestinal 
ecosystem equilibrium (gut dysbiosis) is associated with a plethora of human
diseases, including autoimmune and allergic diseases, colorectal cancer,
metabolic diseases, and bacterial infections. Relevant underlying mechanisms by
which specific intestinal bacteria populations might trigger the development of
disease in susceptible hosts are being explored across the globe. Beneficial
modulation of the gut microbiota using biotherapeutics, such as prebiotics,
probiotics, and antibiotics, may favor health-promoting populations of bacteria
and can be exploited in development of biotherapeutics. Other technologies, such 
as development of human gut models, bacterial screening, and delivery
formulations eg, microencapsulated probiotics, may contribute significantly in
the near future. Therefore, the human gut microbiota is a legitimate therapeutic 
target to treat and/or prevent various diseases. Development of a clear
understanding of the technologies needed to exploit the gut microbiota is
urgently required.

Germinated barley foodstuff contains prebiotics which are reported to have
anti-cancerous effects in colorectal cancer model, but the detailed mechanism
remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that the role of microbiota was strongly
related to the regulation of incidence and progression of colorectal cancer. The 
aim of this study was to examine the anti-neoplastic mechanism by prebiotics.
Azoxymethane treated F344 rats were used as the sporadic cancerous model. After
azoxymethane injection, either a control or germinated barley foodstuff diet was 
administered to the rats for another 5 weeks, and the number of abberant crypt
foci, toll like receptor 4, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog,
adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene and cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA
expression of colonic mucosa and cecal short chain fatty acids were examined. The
germinated barley food stuff significantly attenuated the number of abberant
crypt focis and the expression of toll like receptor 4 and cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA,
compared to the control group. In addition, the cecal butyrate production in the 
germinated barley foodstuff group was significantly higher than that in the
control. In conclusion, this prebiotic treatment for colorectal cancer may be
useful without causing the adverse effects seen in either anti-cancer drugs or
anti-inflammatory drugs.

Multiple factors drive the progression from healthy mucosa towards sporadic
colorectal carcinomas and accumulating evidence associates intestinal bacteria
with disease initiation and progression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
provide a first high-resolution map of colonic dysbiosis that is associated with 
human colorectal cancer (CRC). To this purpose, the microbiomes colonizing colon 
tumor tissue and adjacent non-malignant mucosa were compared by deep rRNA
sequencing. The results revealed striking differences in microbial colonization
patterns between these two sites. Although inter-individual colonization in CRC
patients was variable, tumors consistently formed a niche for Coriobacteria and
other proposed probiotic bacterial species, while potentially pathogenic
Enterobacteria were underrepresented in tumor tissue. As the intestinal
microbiota is generally stable during adult life, these findings suggest that
CRC-associated physiological and metabolic changes recruit tumor-foraging
commensal-like bacteria. These microbes thus have an apparent competitive
advantage in the tumor microenvironment and thereby seem to replace pathogenic
bacteria that may be implicated in CRC etiology. This first glimpse of the CRC
microbiome provides an important step towards full understanding of the dynamic
interplay between intestinal microbial ecology and sporadic CRC, which may
provide important leads towards novel microbiome-related diagnostic tools and
therapeutic interventions.

Monitoring intestinal microbiota profile: a promising method for the ultraearly
detection of colorectal cancer.

University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China.

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and is very hard to be
detected at an ultraearly stage because of lack of valuable predicating methods
that often lead to treatment failure. Intestinal microbiota has long been
considered to implicate in colorectal cancer pathology; and many recent reports
point out a close linkage between the intestinal bacteria and the genesis of the 
tumor. Present studies indicate that the structure and characteristics of the
intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in colorectal cancer,
precancerous lesion, and high risk population compared with healthy controls and 
low risk population. Based on the current studies and theories, we postulate
monitoring the intestinal bacterial profile by the molecular methods that could
fulfill the ultraearly prediction about the degree of the risk developing into
colorectal cancer. Further population-based epidemiological study is useful to
reveal the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in ultraearly colorectal 
cancer, which might provide some novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies
for the colorectal cancer.

The aim was to analyze the microbiota of normal and colon cancer patients in
order to establish cancer-related dysbiosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stool bacterial
DNA was extracted prior to colonoscopy from 179 patients: 60 with colorectal
cancer, and 119 with normal colonoscopy. Bacterial genes obtained by
pyrosequencing of 12 stool samples (6 Normal and 6 Cancer) were subjected to a
validated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) test. The dominant and subdominant
bacterial population (C. leptum, C. coccoides, Bacteroides/Prevotella,
Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc/Pediococcus groups, Bifidobacterium genus, and E. coli,
and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species) were quantified in all individuals
using qPCR and specific IL17 producer cells in the intestinal mucosa were
characterized using immunohistochemistry.
FINDINGS: Pyrosequencing (Minimal sequence 200 nucleotide reads) revealed 80% of 
all sequences could be assigned to a total of 819 taxa based on default parameter
of Classifier software. The phylogenetic core in Cancer individuals was different
from that in Normal individuals according to the PCA analysis, with trends
towards differences in the dominant and subdominant families of bacteria.
Consequently, All-bacteria [log(10) (bacteria/g of stool)] in Normal, and Cancer 
individuals were similar [11.88±0.35, and 11.80±0.56, respectively, (P = 0.16)], 
according to qPCR values whereas among all dominant and subdominant species only 
those of Bacteroides/Prevotella were higher (All bacteria-specific bacterium;
P = 0.009) in Cancer (-1.04±0.55) than in Normal (-1.40±0.83) individuals. IL17
immunoreactive cells were significantly expressed more in the normal mucosa of
cancer patients than in those with normal colonoscopy.
CONCLUSION: This is the first large series to demonstrate a composition change in
the microbiota of colon cancer patients with possible impact on mucosal immune
response. These data open new filed for mass screening and pathophysiology
investigations.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary fibre lowers the risk of
colorectal cancer, which may be due to increased butyrate production from colonic
fermentation of a type of fibre, resistant starch (RS). The present study
investigated the effects of dietary RS and butyrylated RS on the faecal
microbiota of rats treated with azoxymethane. A total of four groups of nine rats
were fed diets containing either standard maize starch (low-amylose maize starch 
(LAMS), low RS), LAMS with 3 % tributyrin (LAMST), cooked 10 % high-amylose maize
starch (HAMS, high RS) or cooked 10 % butyrylated HAMS (HAMSB). Faecal samples
were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 
16S rRNA gene fragments. Multivariate analysis demonstrated no differences
between faecal microbiota before treatment but revealed differences in DGGE
patterns between diet groups, with the exception of the two low-RS groups (LAMS
and LAMST). Subsequent analysis identified eleven DGGE bands contributing
significantly to the differentiation between diets. These phylotypes belonged to 
Clostridiales (five), Lactobacillus (one) and Bacteroidetes (five) lineages. Rats
fed HAMS had increased concentration of propionate in their distal colonic
digesta and developed faecal populations containing Ruminococcus bromii-like
bacteria. HAMSB increased propionate and butyrate concentrations in distal
colonic digesta and was associated with the appearance of two
non-butyrate-producing bacteria, Lactobacillus gasseri and Parabacteroides
distasonis. In conclusion, supplementation with specific dietary RS leads to
changes in faecal microbiota profiles that may be associated with improved bowel 
health.

BACKGROUND: Infection following abdominal operation remains a major factor
affecting the morbidity of patients after surgery.
AIM: To determine the effects of perioperative administration of probiotics on
the gut barrier function and the surgical outcome in patients undergoing elective
colorectal surgery.
METHODS: One hundred patients with colorectal carcinoma were randomly divided
into the control group (n = 50) and the probiotics group (n = 50). The probiotics
were given orally for 6 days preoperatively and 10 days post-operatively.
Outcomes were measured by bacterial translocation, gut permeability, the effect
on the faecal microbiota, and the clinical outcomes such as infectious-related
complications and gut defecation function.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, probiotics group had increased
transepithelial resistance (P < 0.05), reduced transmucosal permeation of
horseradish peroxidase and lactulose/mannitol ratio, reduced bacterial
translocation (P < 0.05), decreased ileal-bile acid binding protein (P < 0.05)
and positive rate of blood bacterial DNA (P < 0.05) and an enhanced mucosal tight
junction protein expression. They had decreased blood enteropathogenic bacteria
and increased faecal bacterial variety. The post-operative recovery of
peristalsis, incidence of diarrhoea, and infectious-related complications were
also improved.
CONCLUSION: Probiotics can improve the integrity of gut mucosal barrier by
benefiting the faecal microbiota, and decreasing infectious complications in
patients with colorectal cancer undergoing colorectomy.

The human large bowel is colonized by complex and diverse bacterial communities. 
However, the relationship between commensal bowel bacteria and adenomas
(colorectal cancer precursors) is unclear. This study aimed to characterize
adherent bacteria in normal colon and evaluate differences in community
composition associated with colorectal adenomas. We evaluated adherent bacteria
in normal colonic mucosa of 21 adenoma and 23 non-adenoma subjects enrolled in a 
cross sectional study. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, clone
sequencing and fluorescent in-situ hybridization analysis of the 16S rRNA genes
were used to characterize adherent bacteria. A total of 335 clones were sequenced
and processed for phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis. Differences in bacterial
composition between cases and controls were evaluated by UniFrac and analysis of 
similarity matrix. Overall, Firmicutes (62%), Bacteroidetes (26%) and
Proteobacteria (11%) were the most dominant phyla. The bacterial composition
differed significantly between cases and controls (UniFrac p < 0.001). We
observed significantly higher abundance of Proteobacteria (p < 0.05) and lower
abundance of Bacteroidetes (p < 0.05) in cases compared to controls. At the genus
level, case subjects showed increased abundance of Dorea spp. (p < 0.005),
Faecalibacterium spp. (p < 0.05) and lower proportions of Bacteroides spp. (p <
0.03) and Coprococcus spp. (p < 0.05) than controls. Cases had higher bacterial
diversity and richness than controls. These findings reveal that alterations in
bacterial community composition associated with adenomas may contribute to the
etiology of colorectal cancer. Extension of these findings could lead to
strategies to manipulate the microbiota to prevent colorectal adenomas and cancer
as well as to identify individuals at high risk.

AIM: To investigate whether probiotic bacteria, given perioperatively, might
adhere to the colonic mucosa, reduce concentration of pathogens in stools, and
modulate the local immune function.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was carried out in 31 subjects
undergoing elective colorectal resection for cancer. Patients were allocated to
receive either a placebo (group A, n = 10), or a dose of 10(7) of a mixture of
Bifidobacterium longum (BB536) and Lactobacillus johnsonii (La1) (group B, n =
11), or the same mixture at a concentration of 10(9) (group C, n = 10).
Probiotics, or a placebo, were given orally 2 doses/d for 3 d before operation.
The same treatment continued postoperatively from day two to day four. Stools
were collected before treatment, during surgery (day 0) and 5 d after operation. 
During the operation, colonic mucosa samples were harvested to evaluate bacterial
adherence and to assess the phenotype of dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocyte
subsets by surface antigen expression (flow cytometry). The presence of BB536 and
La1 was evaluated by the random amplified polymorphism DNA method with specific
polymerase chain reaction probes.
RESULTS: The three groups were balanced for baseline and surgical parameters.
BB536 was never found at any time-points studied. At day 0, La1 was present in
6/10 (60%) patients in either stools or by biopsy in group C, in 3/11 (27.2%) in 
group B, and none in the placebo group (P = 0.02, C vs A). There was a linear
correlation between dose given and number of adherent La1 (P = 0.01). The rate of
mucosal colonization by enterobacteriacae was 30% (3/10) in C, 81.8% (9/11) in B 
and 70% (7/10) in A (P = 0.03, C vs B). The Enterobacteriacae count in stools was
2.4 (log10 scale) in C, 4.6 in B, and 4.5 in A (P = 0.07, C vs A and B). The same
trend was observed for colonizing enterococci. La1 was not found at day +5. We
observed greater expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, and naive and memory lymphocyte
subsets in group C than in group A with a dose response trend (C > B > A).
Treatment did not affect DC phenotype or activation, but after ex vivo
stimulation with lipopolysaccharides, groups C and B had a lower proliferation
rate compared to group A (P = 0.04). Moreover, dendritic phenotypes CD83-123,
CD83-HLADR, and CD83-11c (markers of activation) were significantly less
expressed in patients colonized with La1 (P = 0.03 vs not colonized).
CONCLUSION: La1, but not BB536, adheres to the colonic mucosa, and affects
intestinal microbiota by reducing the concentration of pathogens and modulates
local immunity.

Associations between dietary habits and body mass index with gut microbiota
composition and fecal water genotoxicity: an observational study in African
American and Caucasian American volunteers.

Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. vmai@ufl.edu

BACKGROUND: African Americans (AA) suffer from an increased incidence and
mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). Environmental exposures including dietary
habits likely contribute to a high burden of CRC, however, data on the dietary
habits of AA is sparse. Diet might change the composition and the activities of
the intestinal microbiota, in turn affecting fecal genotoxicity/mutagenicity that
is thought to be associated with carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We assessed dietary habits by food frequency questionnaire and by food
records in 52 AA and 46 CA residents of the Eastern Shore of MD. Fecal microbiota
composition was determined using 16S rRNA based methods and fecal genotoxicity
measured using the Comet assay.
RESULTS: AA reported an increased intake of heterocyclic amines and a decreased
dietary intake of vitamins including vitamin D (p<0.05) that correlated with
differences in fecal microbiota composition but not fecal genotoxicity. Intake of
dietary fiber, calcium, total fat and heterocyclic amines correlated with
differences in microbiota composition. Total bacterial counts/g of stool and raw 
counts of Bacteroides were increased in AA. In contrast to a previous study, BMI 
was not associated with proportions of Bacteroides.
CONCLUSION: Dietary habits of African Americans, including increased HCA intake
and decreased vitamin D intake might at least partially contribute to CRC through
modifications of gut microbiota composition that result in changes of the
intestinal milieu.

It is well established that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role in the
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) collectively
referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Epidemiological studies have
provided strong evidence that IBD patients bear increased risk for the
development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the impact of the microbiota on 
the development of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) remains largely unknown. In
this study, we established a new model of CAC using azoxymethane (AOM)-exposed,
conventionalized-Il10(-/-) mice and have explored the contribution of the host
intestinal microbiota and MyD88 signaling to the development of CAC. We show that
8/13 (62%) of AOM-Il10(-/-) mice developed colon tumors compared to only 3/15
(20%) of AOM- wild-type (WT) mice. Conventionalized AOM-Il10(-/-) mice developed 
spontaneous colitis and colorectal carcinomas while AOM-WT mice were colitis-free
and developed only rare adenomas. Importantly, tumor multiplicity directly
correlated with the presence of colitis. Il10(-/-) mice mono-associated with the 
mildly colitogenic bacterium Bacteroides vulgatus displayed significantly reduced
colitis and colorectal tumor multiplicity compared to Il10(-/-) mice. Germ-free
AOM-treated Il10(-/-) mice showed normal colon histology and were devoid of
tumors. Il10(-/-); Myd88(-/-) mice treated with AOM displayed reduced expression 
of Il12p40 and Tnfalpha mRNA and showed no signs of tumor development. We present
the first direct demonstration that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota
alters the development of CAC. The TLR/MyD88 pathway is essential for
microbiota-induced development of CAC. Unlike findings obtained using the AOM/DSS
model, we demonstrate that the severity of chronic colitis directly correlates to
colorectal tumor development and that bacterial-induced inflammation drives
progression from adenoma to invasive carcinoma.

The normal microbiota and man form a superorganism, in which only 10% are human
cells. The skin and mucous membranes support 10(14) living microbes, mainly at
the end of the gastrointestinal tract, forming a 1.5-kg cell mass ecosystem
mainly consisting of bacteria. Investigations of the intestinal microbiota have
yielded an estimated biodiversity of 1200-16000 bacterial phylotypes. They are
known to affect physiology, development of immune defense, colonization
resistance and nutrition. Changes in microbial population can be associated with 
inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, obesity
and type 2 diabetes.

Intestinal microbiota are considered to play an important role both in colorectal
tumor development and in the modulation of mucosal immunity. Studies on animals
reared in germ-free (GF, without intestinal microbiota) versus conventional (CV, 
with regular microbiota colonization of the bowel) conditions can aid in
clarifying the influence of bacteria on carcinogenesis and the anticancer immune 
response. The capability of the intestinal environment to modulate anticancer
immunity not only at the mucosal but also at the systemic level is still an open 
question. In our study we found that, following the same protocol of colorectal
cancer induction, GF rats developed less and smaller tumors than CV rats. The GF 
rats that did not develop cancer also presented a better anticancer immune
response with an increase in NK, NKT, CTL, B cells and cytotoxicity in peripheral
blood. We hypothesize that the lower antigenic challenge and the absence of the
'physiological inflammation', caused by the commensal microbiota in the gut of CV
rats, may enhance the capability of the GF rats to develop more efficacious
anticancer immune responses. The different levels of tolerance/regulatory
mechanisms in GF versus the CV animals may modulate the anticancer response not
only at the mucosal but also at the systemic immunity level.

A role for the intestinal microbiota is routinely cited as a potential
aetiological factor in colorectal cancer initiation and progression. As the
majority of bacteria in the gut are refractory to culture we investigated this
ecosystem in subjects with colorectal cancer and with adenomatous polyposis who
are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer, using culture-independent
methods. Twenty colorectal cancer and 20 polypectomized volunteers were chosen
for this analysis. An exploration of the diversity and temporal stability of the 
dominant bacteria and several bacterial subgroups was undertaken using 16S rRNA
gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and ribosomal intergenic spacer
analysis (RISA). Metabonomic analysis of the distal gut microbiota's environment 
was also undertaken. A significantly reduced temporal stability and increased
diversity for the microbiota of subjects with colorectal cancer and polyposis was
evident. A significantly increased diversity of the Clostridium leptum and C.
coccoides subgroups was also noted for both disease groups. A clear division in
the metabonome was observed for the colorectal cancer and polypectomized subjects
compared with control volunteers. The intestinal microbiota and their metabolites
are significantly altered in both colorectal cancer and polypectomized subjects
compared with controls.

AIM: To characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in
patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis.
METHODS: A sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a
total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with
diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for
their condition. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the resected mucosal samples
and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and
quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Bifidobacteria were found in 100% of the samples from patients with
diverticulitis or IBD and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. The species B.
longum and B. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by B. animalis, B.
catenulatum and B. adolescentis. B. breve, B. dentium and B. angulatum were not
detected in any sample. A significantly higher occurrence of B. longum was
observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or IBD
(100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained for B.
animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, P < 0.05), while B. adolescentis was only found in the
mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). At the quantitative
level, patients with colon cancer or IBD showed lower counts of total
Bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, P < 0.05) 
and of the species B. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, P < 0.05) than those with
diverticulitis.
CONCLUSION: Aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different 
intestinal diseases. This may indicate a role of the microbiota in the
pathogenesis of these diseases.

Evidence that hydrogen sulfide is a genotoxic agent.

Attene-Ramos MS(1), Wagner ED, Plewa MJ, Gaskins HR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Animal Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by commensal sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are
often members of normal colonic microbiota, represents an environmental insult to
the intestinal epithelium potentially contributing to chronic intestinal
disorders that are dependent on gene-environment interactions. For example,
epidemiologic studies reveal either persistent sulfate-reducing bacteria
colonization or H2S in the gut or feces of patients suffering from ulcerative
colitis and colorectal cancer. However, a mechanistic model that explains the
connection between H2S and ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer development
has not been completely formulated. In this study, we examined the chronic
cytotoxicity of sulfide using a microplate assay and genotoxicity using the
single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE; comet assay) in Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) and HT29-Cl.16E cells. Sulfide showed chronic cytotoxicity in CHO cells
with a %C1/2 of 368.57 micromol/L. Sulfide was not genotoxic in the standard SCGE
assay. However, in a modified SCGE assay in which DNA repair was inhibited, a
marked genotoxic effect was observed. A sulfide concentration as low as 250
micromol/L (similar to that found in human colon) caused significant genomic DNA 
damage. The HT29-Cl.16E colonocyte cell line also exhibited increased genomic DNA
damage as a function of Na2S concentration when DNA repair was inhibited,
although these cells were less sensitive to sulfide than CHO cells. These data
indicate that given a predisposing genetic background that compromises DNA
repair, H2S may lead to genomic instability or the cumulative mutations found in 
adenomatous polyps leading to colorectal cancer.

Changes in cecal microbial metabolism of rats induced by individual and a mixture
of drinking water disinfection by-products.

George SE(1), Wolf DC, Brooks LR, Bailey KC, Hooth MJ, Nelson GM.

(1)Department of Energy, Washington, DC, USA.

Disinfection of drinking water has been one of the greatest public health
successes. Numerous halogenated disinfection by-products (DBPs) occur and chronic
ingestion has been associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer in
human populations. Because the intestinal microbiota can bioactivate xenobiotics,
studies have been performed to examine the effects of individual DBPs on
intestinal microbial metabolism. No studies have been conducted on a defined
mixture of DBPs to determine if there is an enhancement of response to a mixture.
Ten-week-old male Long-Evans rats were treated in their drinking water for 17
weeks with 0.4 g/l potassium bromate, 1.8 g/l chloroform, 0.7 g/l
bromodichloromethane (BDCM), 0.07 g/l
3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX), or a mixture of the
four chemicals or distilled water. Cecal nitroreductase (NR), azoreductase (AR), 
dechlorinase (DC), beta-glucuronidase (GLR), beta-galactosidase (GAL), and
beta-glucosidase (GLU) were assayed. No change in GLU or GLR activity was
detected after treatment. BDCM treatment reduced DC and GAL activities and
elevated NR and AR activity. GAL, AR, and NR activities were significantly
different after treatment with bromate, chloroform, BDCM, and MX, but not the
mixture. DC activity after chloroform-, MX-, or BDCM-treatment was significantly 
below control levels. The present study shows that changes in intestinal
microbial metabolism do occur after treatment with individual and a mixture of
DBPs but the changes were not additive in the mixture group.

CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T lymphocytes inhibit microbially induced colon cancer in
Rag2-deficient mice.

Inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
increase the risk of colorectal cancer in humans. It has been recently shown in
humans and animal models that intestinal microbiota and host immunity are
integral in the progression of large bowel diseases. Lymphocytes are widely
believed to prevent bacterially induced inflammation in the bowel, and
lymphocytes are also critical in protecting against primary tumors of intestinal 
epithelia in mice. Taken together, this raises the possibility that lymphocytes
may inhibit colon carcinogenesis by reducing bacterially driven inflammation. To 
examine the role of bacteria, lymphocytes, and inflammatory bowel disease in the 
development of colon cancer, 129/SvEv Rag-2-deficient and congenic wild-type mice
were orally inoculated with a widespread enteric mouse bacterial pathogen,
Helicobacter hepaticus, or sham-dosed with media only. H. hepaticus-infected
Rag2-/-, but not sham-dosed Rag2-/- mice, rapidly developed colitis and large
bowel carcinoma. This demonstrated a link between microbially driven inflammation
and cancer in the lower bowel and suggested that innate immune dysregulation may 
have an important role in inflammatory bowel disease and progression to cancer.
H. hepaticus-infected wild-type mice did not develop inflammation or carcinoma
showing that lymphocytes were required to prevent bacterially induced cancer at
this site. Adoptive transfer with CD4+ CD45RBlo CD25+ regulatory T cells into
Rag-deficient hosts significantly inhibited H. hepaticus-induced inflammation and
development of cancer. These results suggested that the ability of CD4+ T cells
to protect against intestinal cancer was correlated with their ability to reduce 
bacterially induced inflammatory bowel disease. Further, regulatory T cells may
act directly on the innate immune system to reduce or prevent disease. These
roles for T cells in protection against colon carcinoma may have implications for
new modes of prevention and treatment of cancer in humans.
